Police have used a Taser on a man following a freeway crash in the Adelaide suburb of Leawood Gardens last night.
Emergency services received several calls after a blue Mitsubishi travelling on the down track of the South Eastern Freeway crashed into an embankment about 8.15pm.
"Callers reported that once out of the car, the driver became aggressive and was behaving erratically," South Australia Police said in a statement.

Police said the man was also wanted on an outstanding warrant.
A brief court hearing was held at Adelaide Magistrates Court via a video connection to his bedside. He was refused bail.
He was too sedated following surgery to take part and the case was adjourned for another day.
South Australia Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said frontline officers can face risks, even on routine crash responses.
"People who wear a uniform and respond to assist the public are often putting themselves in harm's way," he said.
"We need the support and cooperation of the community, we don't need to be fighting them."
