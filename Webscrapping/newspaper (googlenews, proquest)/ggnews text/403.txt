MITSUBISHI Motors Australia Ltd has appointed Adam Davis as product PR manager, based at the company’s headquarters in Adelaide.
He replaces Catherine Humphreys-Scott who after almost three years in the Mitsubishi role, has become director of communications and PR at Adelaide-based Callie Marketing.
Mr Davis was most recently B2B and trade content editor at Carsales, having previously served as communications manager at Alpina Automobiles Australia, PR specialist at Mazda Australia and product communications manager for BMW Group Australia.
He also founded the registered charity Drive Against Depression in 2017.
Mr Davis said he thanked his previous employers at Carsales and Mazda for their support and said he was looking forward to “return to a pathway I commenced in 2016 at BMW”.
“Combining automotive product and PR is my calling, and in the coming months and years I look forward to sharing more on where the Mitsubishi business is going,” he said.
“I now cannot wait to work closely with the senior leadership team of Oliver Mann (general manager of marketing and product strategy) and Rob Nazzari (director of marketing and operations).
“I’m also looking forward to working closely with my automotive, business, lifestyle and social media friends once more.”
