The Netherlands became the latest country to enter a lockdown over the Christmas period following a surge in cases.
On Sunday, New South Wales set a new daily caseload record with more than 2500 cases, the highest daily increase in any Australian jurisdiction since the pandemic began.

But, despite the increase, Health Minister Greg Hunt says it’s “not likely” state-wide lockdowns would be reimposed.

“In relation to the Netherlands, my understanding is that their cumulative loss of life is 1400 per cent of that which has occurred in Australia,” Mr Hunt told reporters on Sunday.
“As I say, we’re going into summer, we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, and a very different set of circumstances.
“Each country will make their judgement on their own circumstances, but we don’t see that as a likely situation in Australia.
“We are well prepared and people are overwhelmingly, I have to say, continuing to do an amazing job.”
"We don’t see that’s a likely situation in Australia "
Less than a week from Christmas - and its family gatherings - NSW recorded its highest ever number of daily COVID-19 cases on Sunday.
