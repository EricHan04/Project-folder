Bookmakers say the past six weeks have had little impact on the federal election outcome, posting near-identical odds to those at the start of the campaign.
TAB makes Labor a $1.50 favourite to win Saturday night's count, with the coalition underdogs at $2.65.
That implies around a 67 per cent chance of Anthony Albanese becoming prime minister.

The odds were practically level after the campaign's first week included Mr Albanese's jobless rate "gaffe", but swung drastically to see Labor begin the final week at $1.25, with the coalition priced at $4.
But that price was gobbled up, with Scott Morrison's party attracting plenty of money in the past few days.
"After all the colour and movement of the six-week campaign we find ourselves effectively back where we started in terms of prices," TAB's Gerard Daffy said.
"While some people might be glad it's all coming to an end, punters have really embraced the election with TAB expected to hold three times the amount we held on the 2019 federal election."
TAB says a Labor majority government is the most likely outcome at $1.95, followed by Labor minority ($3.50), coalition minority ($4.50) and coalition majority ($5.50).
And if you're trying to figure out which way the election will go, perhaps psychic crocodile Speckles has you sorted.
The 4.7m saltwater crocodile was presented with posters of both leaders - with some meaty snacks attached - at Darwin's Crocodylus Park.
Speckles opted for a Labor win.
