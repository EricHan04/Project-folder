Even while enjoying the most promising form of his young career, Félix Auger-Aliassime knew a top-class performance would be required to beat No. 2 seed and defending champion Andrey Rublev of Russia in the semi-finals of the ATP 500 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam. And the Canadian produced just that as he claimed a thrilling 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-2 victory to set up a mouth-watering clash with No. 1 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece on Sunday.
No. 3 seed Auger-Aliassime previously reached the final of this tournament in 2020, when he was beaten by France’s Gael Monfils. In the lead up to this match against Rublev, the 21-year-old Montrealer had dropped just a single set on his way to beating Belarus’ Egor Gerasimov and British duo Andy Murray and Cameron Norrie.
Rublev, meanwhile, had enjoyed straight-sets victories over Henri Laaksonen of Switzerland, South Korea’s kwon Soo-woo and Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics. Their head-to-head record was firmly in the Russian’s favour with Rublev having beaten Auger-Aliassime in their two previous meetings (Umag, 2018 and Adelaide, 2020).
With an ATP Cup title and Australian Open quarter-finals berth already under his belt, Auger-Aliassime has been showing a steely determination and will to win so far in 2022. That momentum carried into this match as the Canadian went blow for blow with his opponent with just two rankings’ places between the 21-year-old Quebecer (No. 9) and the 24-year-old from Moscow (No. 7).
There was nothing to separate the two players in the first set, which looked destined to be heading for a tiebreak. That was until, with a 6-5 lead, Auger-Aliassime went 0:40 up on Rublev’s serve. The Russian did well to deny him on all three break point opportunities, and for a fourth time when Auger-Aliassime had the advantage at deuce, before seeing out the game to force a tiebreaker.
It’s as tight as a match gets, but Rublev takes his chances and the first set, 7-6 in the Rotterdam quarter final versus Félix.
