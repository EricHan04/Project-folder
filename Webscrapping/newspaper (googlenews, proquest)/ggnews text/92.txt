CareApp, a powerful communication and engagement platform for aged care providers has been backed by Adelaide investor group Southern Angels, a not-for-profit network of high net worth individuals.
Former co-founder and previous owner of Wellness & Lifestyles Australia and W & L Learning, Nick Heywood-Smith has joined the board of CareApp as part of the deal.
CareApp founder Allison Nikula says, the app allows carers to photograph – with permission – people in care while updating their records, noting anything from physical and mood changes through to whether they are taking medication.
Since signing up SA provider St Louis Home Care as its first customer, CareApp has entered licence agreements with 16 aged care service providers across the country.
Over the next 12 months, it will be rolled out to a further 80 service providers, to reach more than 15,000 users in care.
