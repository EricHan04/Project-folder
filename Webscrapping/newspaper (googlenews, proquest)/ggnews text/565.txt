The South Australian government is searching for a “visionary” developer to help deliver a sustainable masterplanned 60ha residential community.
The greenfield site is one of the largest broadacre landholdings in Aldinga, 45km south of the Adelaide CBD.
Renewal SA said it was looking for an innovative development partner to deliver about 1000 low- to medium-density houses with a 7-Star or higher NatHERS rating.
It will accommodate about 2500 residents, with construction due to commence in 2023.
“The release-to-market of 60ha of greenfield land bound by Main South Road, Aldinga Beach Road, How Road and Quinliven Road represents a significant development opportunity that will support projected population growth in one of the fastest growing regions in the state,” McGees Property Adelaide director James Juers said.
“The development will need to respond to the existing character of Aldinga and encompass an attractive, climate-smart, low- to medium-density neighbourhood that favours open green spaces and connects seamlessly to surrounding residences, businesses, schools and parks.”
Renewal SA chief executive Chris Menz said Aldinga had been through a period of growth and was a thriving township with strong demand for housing supply.
“We are seeking an experienced development partner with the capability and vision to build on the existing amenity at Aldinga and support its long-term growth and prosperity,” he said.
“This new master-planned community will need to reflect Aldinga’s existing character, encompass exceptional sustainable design features and deliver a diverse range of housing types and price points to facilitate choice and affordability.”
Aldinga’s new birth-to-Year 12 school, Aldinga Payinthi College, will be at the centre of the major master-planned community development, which will be close to Port Willunga Beach, the McLaren Vale wine region and Aldinga’s town centre.
