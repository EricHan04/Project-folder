With top makes on sale including Porsche, Alfa Romeo, Mitsubishi, Audi and Toyota, Aussies can buy online and take advantage of free metro delivery in 7 days or less.
CARS24. The company is Australia’s first 100% online car retailer, and given it is nearly the end of the financial year, it has launched what it says is "the largest online-only EOFY used car sale in the country, with over $600,000 in savings across its entire inventory."
Over 400 quality used cars will be discounted over 30 days, providing customers with a chance to review and consider before purchase, and by now, quite a few of that 400 must already be sold, but no doubt, bargain still remain.
With used car prices continuing to soar, along seemingly these days with everything else, and with record wait times of up to 12 months for new vehicles (along with longer wait times for a range of goods), CARS24 is hoping a deal of being able to save "up to $5,000" on their next vehicle, while also taking advantage of free metro delivery in seven days or less, will be irresistible, at least to some buyers who are keen to buy a car before the financial year his over.
Top vehicles on sale when the promotion started include:
Porsche Macan 2016 – save up to $5,000
Alfa Romeo Giulia 2016 – save up to $3,700
Mitsubishi Pajero Sport 2018 – save up to $3,200
Audi A3 2019 – save up to $2,600
Toyota Hilux 2017 – save up to $2,500
Naturally, CARS24 says it is "the most convenient and trustworthy way to purchase a used car in Australia," and unlike marketplace offerings, CARS24 proudly boasts it owns all 1,500+ advertised vehicles, and that every car undergoes a mandatory 300-point inspection to ensure car quality.
