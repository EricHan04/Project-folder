It’s every musician’s nightmare that as they’re loading in for a gig and they get issued a parking ticket in the short time their vehicle is parked.
An initiative from the City of Adelaide will see those pesky fines a thing of the past for active musicians as they launched the Live Music Loading Zones Project.
The project is a part of the City of Adelaide’s commitment to continually supporting the city’s vibrant live music culture.
Several city venues and North Adelaide live music venues will now offer available loading options for musicians and their crew.
There will be an orange ‘City of Music’ sign atop these designated loading zones.
This will allow any musician to load their gear in and out of the venue with a maximum of 30 minutes to do so.
Much better than trying to lug a Marshall quad box up a flight of stairs in two minutes.
Musicians can’t just pull up and state they are a musician when trying to use the loading zones.
Applications for the City of Music artists stickers are a must. The sticker must be visible and placed on your vehicle.
Once all this is in place, you’re free to rock ‘n’ roll all night and party every day!
