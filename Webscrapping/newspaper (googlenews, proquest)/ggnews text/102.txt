Baptist Care looks interstate for new CEO
Victorian Salvation Army Manager Shane Austin has been appointed CEO of Baptist Care SA.
His appointment follows the departure of former Baptist Care SA CEO Graham Brown in December, who had spent four years in the top job and has now transitioned into the world of consultancy.
Austin’s move to South Australia comes after more than two and a half years as the Salvation Army’s State Manager for Homelessness Victoria.
The experienced community sector executive is a former CEO of St Kilda Community Housing and Research Director at the Melbourne Lord Mayor’s Charitable Foundation, focusing on homelessness and ageing initiatives.
Last year, he played a leading role in the establishment of the new Adelaide South homelessness services alliance – Toward Home – of which Baptist Care SA is a member.
Baptist Care SA Chair Julie Lawrie touted the “balance of skills” Austin brings to the new role.
“His corporate experience spanning organisational development, strategic planning and stakeholder engagement coupled with his faith and a passion for social change and public policy will be invaluable to Baptist Care SA,” Lawrie said.
Austin’s new employers work across various sectors including disability care, youth education, employment and homelessness. The not-for-profit’s workforce numbers just under 900 employees and 300 volunteers.
