The only festival in Adelaide to induce Homer Simpson-style drooling at the mouth, and the only festival where your excessive salivation will be completely understood and acceptable, ABBF (15-17 July) is a three-day gathering of the finest purveyors of BBQ and beer in South Australia (as well as a stack of interstate guests).While you're feeding your gut and quenching your thirst, the live music on offer will have you burning off those excessive calories in no time.The band line-up is headlined by Skegss and The Smith Street Band as well as appearances from Bodyjar, Private Function, 28 Days, Wagons, Jess Locke, Scabz, Wing Defence, Hubris, Los Palms, Molly Rocket and Mums Favourite.In between the bands will be plenty of dance-floor action with a host of DJs spinning the tunes including DJ Mermaid (aka Lady Gaga's favourite DJ) plus Driller, The Continental, Feris Mular, Just Like Whatever collective, Pigs In A Blanket feat. Penfold, Cloak & Dagga and Nixon, Sh.t Disco, and a special DJ set by local punk rockers Young Offenders.While the music will keep you energised, you'll need plenty of fuel to keep your legs dancing.Luckily you'll have some of Australia's best BBQ chefs firing up a storm including cult burger joint Huxtaburger, local legends Sneaky Pickle collab with pitmaster Mike Patrick's Fancy Hanks, and the world debut of Sarah Turner and Alana Brabin's Big Bad Wolf.If that isn't enough meat juice for ya, big flavour exports Hoy Pinoy bring their Filipino grills to Adelaide, while RGs are the stalwarts of the low and slow BBQ.For the vegans in your herd, Two-Bit Villains will make a very rare and special festival appearance."It's a massive cliché but there really is something for everyone at ABBF. There are so many genres of music, market stalls, and the return of the BBQ comp, so we can't wait to get into it," ABBF Co-Director Aaron Sandow says.When it comes time to wash down your crispy chicken strips and tender bbq ribs, the assortment of brewers on-hand is next level.The great folks at Gilbert Street Hotel are bringing their much-loved international container to the festival featuring an extraordinary amount of international beer brands you would struggle to find anywhere else.Pirate Life always goes large at ABBF and this year's Pirate Life Rec Centre is huge. Think a skateboarding ramp with pro skaters, big screen TV to watch the football, pinball machines, and a truck pouring brewery-fresh beer, does it get any better?Not to be outdone Big Shed's House Of Fun will feature an onsite microbrewery, DJs, and special one-off collabs. As always Sh.t Can Tavern will be there with all your tinnie desires.Then there's Balter out of Queensland, Boatrocker Brewers from Victoria, and locals Shifty Lizard Brewing Co and South Coast, and a whole stack more."The beers we have on offer at the fest are top tier for anywhere around the world but we know not everyone's a beer drinker and the other beverages announced today show the quality of our beverage industry here in SA and Australia and we can't wait to get around it," Aaron says."The activations from the likes of Pirate Life and Big Shed Brewing are going to be a heck of a time; we couldn't be more pumped.”Adelaide Beer & BBQ Festival takes place at Adelaide Showground 15-17 July. Tickets are on sale.
