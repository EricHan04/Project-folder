The first week of tournaments of the 2022 season just took place and there’s already a new career-high for one of the biggest names in the game, as Felix Auger-Aliassime rises to No. 9 on the ATP rankings following his heroics at the ATP Cup.
Alongside Denis Shapovalov, Auger-Aliassime took Canada all the way to the title at the team event, even getting the biggest win of his career along the way against Alexander Zverev—his win over the No. 3-ranked German was his first Top 5 win.
Both Canadians added points to their rankings, but while Shapovalov stays at No. 14 this week, Auger-Aliassime moves up two spots from No. 11 to No. 9, hopping over his previous high of No. 10, which he got to for one week last November.
The 21-year-old hopes the result will inspire the whole team to bigger things in 2022.
“Winning is not easy, it takes a lot of effort, a lot of work,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I think for sure that this momentum, at least for Denis and I, we played matches, but for the other guys, I’ve been in situations also in the past where I was a part of the team that won something, and just that feeling of winning, the confidence that it brings to each individual, I think is great. So I think that’s why this event is great.
“I hope the best to all the boys for the rest of the season. We have a lot of belief in each other. Hopefully this carries on, not just this week, but a lot of months to come.”
Auger-Aliassime is now the standalone fifth-highest-ranked Canadian in either ATP or WTA rankings history, and one of six in total to reach the Top 10.
