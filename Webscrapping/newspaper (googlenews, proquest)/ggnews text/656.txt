Lauren Giorgio is a scientist, company executive and entrepreneur who’s on a mission to help commercialise innovative new technologies to improve the health of the community.
The COO of GPN Vaccines said she had built her career on identifying opportunities from academic research and assembling teams and strategies to drive commercialisation across the pharmaceutical, medical device, diagnostic and digital health sectors.
Prior to her role with GPN Vaccines, Giorgio spent four years in Melbourne where she worked on projects for The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and Centre for Eye Research Australia. During this time, she assisted with a landmark anti-cancer treatment Venetoclax deal, worth more than AUD$400 million.
She also co-founded the Women in Leadership Development Program.
The initiative scored a $176,000 Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grant from the Federal Government to help provide young female leaders in STEM with board training, mentorship and executive leadership skills.
In 2019 Giorgio joined GPN Vaccines.
Working closely with The University of Adelaide, the company is developing a new, broad-spectrum pneumococcal vaccine with the potential to save millions of lives each year.
Giorgio said she planned to take on more board positions to help guide start-up companies through the early stages of their development.
