A photograph of a car in one Bunnings carpark has left Reddit users scratching their heads for a very unusual reason.
The image shows a parked Mitsubishi Pajero which has certainly seen better days.
While most motorists go to extreme lengths to keep their vehicles rust-free, the opposite appears to apply to this car.

The Pajero is covered in rust from one end to the other, so much so that every panel - except for the bumpers, door handles and side mirrors - has eroded.
A passing motorist shared a snap of the car on Reddit saying, “Found this rust bucket at Bunnings.”

Many were left wondering if it was the rustiest car in Australia.
“Damn you’ve gotta TRY to get a car that rusty,” said one.
Added another: “It’s honestly beautiful how rusty it is, makes it the perfect anti-theft feature.”
