Movements on ASC board
Geoff Rohrsheim has been promoted to Deputy Chair of ASC, with the submarine builders also adding Julie Cooper and Denise Goldsworthy AO to their board.
Rohrsheim, the prominent South Australian IT entrepreneur who co-founded Cevo Australia, Arinco and Hatch Creations, has been an ASC Director since May 2019.
The non-executive role at Osborne is one of three ongoing board commitments for Rohrsheim alongside his director role with the Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre and Chairmanship of Real Estate Sales Online.
Cooper, meanwhile, is a Corporate Ladder regular with one of the state’s most extensive portfolio of directorship appointments, including Chair of both the South Australian Film Corporation and Nova Systems.
Her other ongoing board roles are with Credit Union SA, aged care organisation Helping Hand, construction company Sarah Group, the Adelaide Crows Foundation and the National Council of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.
ASC has also looked to Perth to replenish its board, with Goldsworthy, Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, set to join as a director in May.
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham made all three appointments prior to the Federal Government entering caretaker mode.
