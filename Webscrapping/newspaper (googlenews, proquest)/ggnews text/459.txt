The Labor opposition’s win in the South Australian election on Saturday looks set to end plans for a new $667 million sports and entertainment arena in Adelaide’s CBD.
The proposed 15,000 capacity venue on the banks of Adelaide’s River Torrens was an early election promise by outgoing South Australian Premier Steven Marshall, with the 15,000 pax venue to replace the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.
The venue was to be connected via a tunnel to the Adelaide Convention Centre in a bid to attract large scale conventions alongside its main function to host large sports and entertainment events.
However, in the build up to the election Labor attacked the proposal calling it a $667 million “basketball stadium”, and instead saying they would spend the money on healthcare.
Speaking during the election campaign, Premier-elect Peter Malinauskas commented “our health system needs more resources now, not a basketball stadium."
However, in another pre-election pledge, Malinauskas said Labor would bring back the Adelaide 500 race lost during the last state government’s incumbency.
Welcoming a potential return for the race, Supercars Chief Executive, Shane Howard stated “we congratulate Peter Malinauskas and his team on their victory in the South Australian election.
“We now look forward to working together to deliver the Adelaide 500 on the streets of Adelaide in December in what will be a spectacular season finale.”
South Australia’s music industry also backed the return of the Adelaide 500, looking forward to the benefits of its track-side concerts
During the campaign, many in the South Australian music industry actively campaigned for Labor.
Promoter, advocate and musician Rob Pippan told The Industry Observer “it’s a significant win for us.
“Labor’s arts policy has a lot of components, and they really listened to our concerns, and made us feel they wanted to make a difference.”
Labor leader Peter Malinauskas attended the Adelaide Music Summit on 1st March and listened to 150 executives talk about challenges and solutions to the state’s live sector, which employs more than 4,500.
Labor’s arts strategy includes $3.25 million in See It LIVE grants for promoters, consisting of $5,000 each for 100 club gigs, 25 grants of $500,000 each for theatres and wineries, and five grants of $250,000 each for major events.
A further $250,000 to Support Act provides wellbeing workshops for SA music workers, while Adelaide Fringe gets a $2 million annual boost.
Festivals and events which have to cancel due to a pandemic outbreak or on health ministry orders will get compensation of between $10,000 and $250,000 from a $5 million insurance fund while $1 million has been proposed for upgrades to music venues and $500,000 is allocated for concerts at the Royal Adelaide Show.
In addition, a Premier’s Live Music Advisory Council will be set up with the sector to engage with the government, provide advice, propose new initiatives and identify new developments.
