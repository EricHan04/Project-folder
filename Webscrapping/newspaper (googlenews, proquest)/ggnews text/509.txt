It’s hard to believe that Australia didn’t have a creative business school – that is, until Compton School came along.
Founded by David Court in 2017, the Compton School was established to fulfill a dire need for structured guidance in creative arts businesses. Now, Australian creatives can get tailor-made insight into how arts businesses function, and how they can manage such a business themselves.
The Compton School is led by an experienced group of industry professionals known as Creative Fellows, and is open to anyone in the arts industry with a bit of experience under their belt. It offers carefully considered courses in leadership, finance, structures, strategy and decision-making – all through the lens of creative innovation.
Chloe Rickard, a screen producer and Compton Creative Fellow, said that teaching at Compton School gave her the chance to share her experience, both as an owner of a creative enterprise and as a filmmaker. ‘I can give industry insight as well as my own warts-and-all experience,’ she said.
‘I look forward to sharing my career musings with students, who I also learn a great deal from in the process. The circle of knowledge sharing is a highlight.’
