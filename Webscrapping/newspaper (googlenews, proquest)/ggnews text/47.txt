Former world No. 3 Marin Cilic is leaving Australia in positive spirits as he congratulated Felix Auger-Aliassime on a great round-of-16 battle. On Monday, world No. 9 Auger-Aliassime defeated Cilic 2-6 7-6 (7) 6-2 7-6 (4) to progress into the Australian Open quarterfinal.
Cilic enjoyed a good Australian summer, having reached semifinals in Adelaide and Adelaide 2. "Tough loss last night but a great month in Australia & a great start to the 2022 season. Congrats to @felixtennis on a hard fought battle.
Thanks to all the fans supporting here and across all the time zones. Leaving Oz with lots of positives," Cilic tweeted.
Auger-Aliassime showed respect to Cilic
Auger-Aliassime approached Cilic after the match and called him a champion.
Cilic is a three-time Grand Slam finalist and his lone Grand Slam title came at the 2014 US Open. “It puts my self-belief even higher,” Auger-Aliassime said in his on-court interview. “This was my first win against him, at an important moment like this.
I told him at the end of the match, he’s a champion, the way he handles himself, the way he plays, so he’s going to come out with his best level and test me and make me earn my win. I’m really relieved and happy to get through, especially the way I did it”.
Auger-Aliassime impressively recovered from a set down to beat Cilic. “He was hitting so clean at the start of the match,” said Auger-Aliassime. “I played one poor game at 4-2 but the rest of the set I think he was just playing better than me, doing everything better.
The second was tight, but that was a crucial turnaround. You can’t afford to go two-sets-to-love down, that would have been tough, so that was a crucial moment and then in the third I started feeling better and better”.
