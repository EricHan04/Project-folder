With three tournaments throughout the leafy season, you can swap your gin paddle for a ping pong paddle and make it a double serve in Prohibition’s very own table tennis Olympics. (Don’t worry though, there is definitely still gin involved).
Players of any standard are welcome to play in this once-a-month round-robin competition but spots are limited to 16 competitors so tickets are a necessity.
At $25 not only will you be entered into both the singles and doubles comp, but you’ll also get a G&T (your choice of original, blood orange or moonlight) AND one of Prohibition’s signature gourmet toasties.
So, what does the winner take home you ask? Win the singles comp and you’ll take home a 700ml bottle of Original Gin while the best performing doubles team will score a G&T to enjoy either on-site or take home for the road.
And if you need a little support from your cheer squad to get you over the line in the big tournament, bring them down and they can take advantage of the drink specials and cheap toasties will cheering you on from the sidelines.
After a casual hit? The ping pong table will be set up at the Prohibition Distillery Tasting Room on Gilbert Street every Wednesday night this autumn – grab a gin paddle and a ping pong paddle and serve up some laughs.
The first event was a hit (pardon the pun) so make sure you don’t miss out on the next one.
