The new era of Festival Plaza will kick off its entertainment offering with Festival Plaza presents, a diverse and free program of live local DJs, music, art, entertainment and games, the new Festival Plaza will offer something for everyone.
Bring the kids along to lounge around the water feature, or better yet, frolic in it! Immerse yourself in the giant interactive screen which switches from entertainment to local, interactive art. Or simply meet friends at the Festival Plaza cafe by day, or for a tipple or two at the Arbour Bar by night.
And when the sun does set on weekends, sit back, relax and watch the space come to life with the lights and sounds of local SA talent.
