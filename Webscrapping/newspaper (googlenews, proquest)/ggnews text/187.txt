The Australian Institute of Architects has announced the winners of the 2022 South Australian Architecture Awards.
Ashley Halliday Architects won the highest honour awarded to a project in the SA Awards program for Mount Gambier Regional Airport.
The jury said that despite the airport’s low-profile built form, it represented the standout project for its “quietly ambitious addition to the landscape of the Limestone Coast”. Featuring a generous skylight as a striking central feature, the jury said the new airport pushed the boundaries of what is expected of regional terminals.
Ashley Halliday Architects also received the Jack McConnell Award for Public Architecture for Mount Gambier Regional Airport and the highest honour for residential architecture with Parkside Residence.
All winners of awards and named awards will progress to the National Architecture Awards to be announed on 3 November.
