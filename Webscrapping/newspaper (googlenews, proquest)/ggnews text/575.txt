The State Government will advertise for a permanent replacement, after parting ways with former CEO John Hanlon in July.
Hanlon had been on leave since September last year, along with fellow executive Georgina Vasilevski, whose current employment status is unknown despite numerous requests for clarification over several weeks.
Hanlon was originally replaced by corporate service manager Damian De Luca, but he was in turn replaced by Project Delivery mentor Devine.
