Royal Adelaide Hospital and The Queen Elizabeth Hospital have implemented eight digital patient pathways co-designed with local firm Personify Care to relieve pressure on frontline staff by digitising previously manual clinical protocols.
Personify Care worked with the Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) on the roll-out for CALHN patients in more than 20 speciality areas across the two hospitals, as well as SA Dental.
