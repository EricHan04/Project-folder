A 'ladies-only' nightclub is set to open its doors in Adelaide, offering women the chance to "dance, mingle and enjoy" without the presence of men.
A far cry from the traditional 'ladies' night' concept, LUX nightclub allows entry to male patrons, but only if accompanied by a female partner.

The club, located on Adelaide's popular Hindley Street strip, encourages women to "own the night".
The concept has been met with predominately-positive responses on social media, with many women labelling it a "great idea".
A video promoting the launch of the club, shared to Facebook, attracted nearly 50 comments from those "looking forward" to Saturday night.
Exemptions allowed
While a women's-only club may seem prejudiced, the Equal Opportunity Act grants exemptions that allow discrimination in certain areas or activities.
While unable to comment on the particular venue, Equal Opportunity Commissioner Dr Niki Vincent told 7NEWS.com.au that in certain circumstances businesses or organisations can be granted such leeway.
"There are exemptions allowed in certain circumstances," Vincent said.

"We do get a lot of organisations coming and saying, 'Can we set up a woman-only scholarship,' or other similar requests."
"These are often granted, as long as there are plenty of other opportunities for men and it's not being divisive."
However, Vincent says anyone with formal complaints regarding such exemptions can file them with the Commission.
7NEWS contacted LUX for comment but its operators chose not to speak at this time.
