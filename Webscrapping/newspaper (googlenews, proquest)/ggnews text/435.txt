Phil Mumford
GroupM agency Wavemaker has promoted Phil Mumford to Adelaide managing director.
Mumford will lead the agency, which has long-standing relationships with clients including Mitsubishi Motors, Government of South Australia, Bridgestone, San Remo, UniSA and South Australian Tourism, and be part of Wavemaker’s national leadership team.
Mumford joined Wavemaker over six years ago as client director, before rising to the post of general manager in March 2018. As managing director he is replacing Matt Hofmeyer, who has taken up the new position of managing director of Wavemaker Hong Kong.
Wavemaker Australia & New Zealand CEO Peter Vogel said: “As a key member of the Adelaide team for the past six and a half years, Phil has played a critical role in the success of our South Australian clients and the development of our people. His promotion is well deserved recognition of his immense contribution."
“At Wavemaker, we’re big believers in promoting from within – it not only rewards talented and committed people for their hard work, it also benefits our clients by ensuring continuity and the retention of valuable IP."
