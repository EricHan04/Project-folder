Police will allege a Holden Cruze was travelling north on the northern expressway when the driver collided with wire cabling on the median strip and lost control, which caused the vehicle to spin.
A second car, a Holden station wagon, also travelling in the same direction swerved to avoid colliding with the Cruze.
