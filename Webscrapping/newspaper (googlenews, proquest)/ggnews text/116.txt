Tech group Code Like a Girl is launching a new internship program aimed at getting more women into technology jobs, as the sector continues to struggle to lift the number of women in technical roles.
Set to begin in January, Code like a Girl is hoping to put up to 100 women through its first internship intake, partnering with technology companies in Melbourne for the first round.
The successful applicants will work on-site within a tech team, with the paid positions lasting for three months, six months or 12 months.

Code Like a Girl co-founder Vanessa Doake said the organisation will only partner with tech businesses it believes have made a genuine commitment to addressing diversity in their companies.
"When we assess organisations coming on board we look at things like if they have a gender split on their boards, if they're publicly speaking about the issue and how to tackle it and if they have equitable policies and procedures. A big one at the moment is around paid parental leave, for both men and women," she said.
