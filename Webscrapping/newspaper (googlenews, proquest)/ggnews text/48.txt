Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Andrey Rublev, and Felix Auger Aliassime will be back to competitions next week in Rotterdam (ATP500) after a rather eventful Australian Open.
The local organization was hoping for a last-minute appearance of Novak Djokovic who was not able to play the Australian Open after being deported. However, as of now, that does not seem to happen.
