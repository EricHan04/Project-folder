HAWTHORNS premiership
defence began on
a Friday night at the
MCG with a beating
from Geelong. Losing had an
alibi then: too many premiership
players missing, too rushed
a preparation. It all but finished
on another Friday night at the
MCG, with a beating from Adelaide.
There were no excuses
now. Nine premiership players
still were missing, the latest and
most sorely missed Jarryd
Roughead. But theHawks have
had four months to adopt and
adapt. Last year, they looked the
team of best-laid plans. This
year, they look the team of their
unpicking. Last season, the
Hawks got on a roll. This year,
they didnt ever really get going.
The story of this, their last
hurrah, can be told as a series of
huddles.Humans huddle for
different reasons, to make a
compact about togetherness, to
regroup in adversity, to commune
in triumph.Hawthorns
first huddle was in the prematch
warm-up. It was to foster
togetherness, but it also was a
rehearsal. The first half consisted
of huddles, one in the middle,
one on each forward line.
Mostly, Luke Hodge was in his
own personal huddle as he looked
to shake Robert Shirleys tag
by tagging another Crow.
In such a madding crowd,
clean possession was rare and
some of the most important
touches were barely touches at
all. In this maelstrom, momentarily
the Hawthorn of old asserted
itself. Its first was made by
Cyril Riolis flying tackle on
Bernie Vince. Its second was
Riolis doing, lashing the ball out
of mid-air 30 metres from goal;
somehow, the ball spun like a
truly kicked drop punt.
The fifth arrived when Lance
Franklin slipped a handball
away at half-back, then seconds
later laid a crushing tackle on
Scott Stevens in the forward
pocket. Franklins contribution
stood out then because his
movement was longitudinal in a
game was being played mostly
laterally. It was as if both teams
were playing to imaginary goal
posts set on the wings.
TheHawks of old led by 31
points, but not for the first time
this season had flattered to
deceive. The Crows kicked the
next six goals, meantime barely
allowing the Hawks into their
forward 50. Now the silkiness of
AndrewMcLeod stood out as
the silkiness of Rioli had in the
first quarter, the old master
usurping the young.
Goals came from Kurt Tippetts
powerful goal square
mark, fromMcLeods lateral
vision, then from a masterpiece
of improvisation from Brett
Hentschel, playing only his third
game in two years.Hemmed
into the forward pocket, he
swept an almost-dead ball
against the legs of aHawthorn
player, from whence it ricocheted
out on the full. Then,
coolly, he converted from an
acute angle. It gave the Crows
the lead, and they did not relinquish
it. Hentschel added three
more goals in the second half to
save two projects, Adelaides
flickering top four hopes and his
own career.
The second half was for Adelaide
to consolidate the gains of
the first. The Crows are more
robotic than inspired, meticulous
rather than surprising. The
Hawks of yesteryearlast year
might have sliced them to
pieces. But theHawks of 2009
were too busy fighting their own
devils, the spawn of diminished
manpower, an unsettled line-up
and ever dwindling confidence.
They were unable to burst
through lines as they did last
year, or even last month against
Collingwood, lacked crispness,
turned the ball over repeatedly,
kicked for goal atrociously and
were unable to improvise.
From the 22-minute mark of
the first quarter, they kicked
four goals, all Franklins; thereby
hangs the tale. One was breathtaking;
a gather while on a banking
run, a snap from 50 metres,
an optical illusion. There was
one last huddle at threequarter-
time, but nothing rubbed
off except massage oil.
A mood of resignation settled
over the match. The crowd was
less than 33,000, and not all
stayed for the last rites. It was not
as if theHawks had their moral
superiority snatched away from
them; it was never really theirs to
hold. It was a mild night inMelbourne
for August, hinting more
at September. Excepting miracles,
it is the only hint the Hawks will have this year.
