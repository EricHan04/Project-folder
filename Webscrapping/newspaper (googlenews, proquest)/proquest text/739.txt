ONE of the speakers at Southstart’s student-focused Bright Ideas Summit is yet to hit double digits in age, but is already one of the state’s best-connected people through her mission to inspire young people.
Nine-year-old Isabella Taylor, of Crafers, is a talented artist with a focus on the ocean and space, who has interviewed some of South Australia’s top entrepreneurs as part of her “Inspired By” video series. Isabella has interviewed actor Tilda Cobham-Hervey, space entrepreneur Flavia Tata Nardini and director, writer and producer Daniel J. Phillips, among others.
Isabella started the project three years ago, inspired by the stories of high-achieving people her mother Sara was reading to her.
“I was so inspired by what I was hearing I said to mum, ‘ we can do this’,’’ she said. “I wanted to help young people follow their dreams ... regardless of their circumstances by sharing stories of inspirational people.’’ The first person Isabella interviewed was culinary icon Maggie Beer. “She was lovely. When you see these icons it really tells you a lot about the reasons they say yes,’’ Isabella said.
“They’re not just icons, they’re motivationally kind, they’re giving of themselves and that’s what gets them to the position they are.’’ Isabella and Sara contact people via email to request interviews and said they received an overwhelming response.
Isabella will make a keynote address and take part in a panel discussion at the Bright Ideas Summit, which is a collaboration with Adelaide University, Hacker Exchange, Future Anything and the State Government. The summit is at the National Wine Centre on May 4, with 300 students attending. It will also be streamed to classrooms nationally.
