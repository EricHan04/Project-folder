A FEDERAL Government report that could allow the public to invest more easily in the next big thing was released yesterday.
The 245 page report from the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee (CAM-AC) recommends that crowdsourced equity funding should be allowed in Australia following the introduction of similar, and successful, legislation in the US, UK and New Zealand.
It has suggested changes to the Corporations Act to facilitate the new funding. "Crowdsourcing is gaining momentum worldwide," said Tim Heasley, from Sydney based Artesian Capital Management, which set up an equity crowd funding platform, VentureCrowd, earlier this year.
"The recommendations should see a lot of early-stage capital flow into the market." Crowd-funding is seen as a new method of raising equity in corporate start-ups via intermediary companies such as VentureCrowd. Companies seeking to raise equity this way will be able to do so by becoming an "exempt public company".CAMAC says individual investors should be limited to spending $2500 in a particular company and $10,000 in total each year.
