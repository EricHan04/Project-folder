A NEW batch of 10 selected Australian businesses will this week begin a nine-month program to prepare for their next phase of growth, supported by the ANZ Bank.
Interstate companies make up Class 6 of the ANZ Business Growth program, delivered by the University of SA-based Australian Centre for Business Growth, which is headed by Dr Jana Matthews. The bank funds six seminars, 75 clinic places and the nine-month program for selected customers. Since 2014, 50 customers, including SA-based Makers Empire and 4 Ways Fresh, have participated.
ANZ business banking general manager Jenefer Stewart said the focus was on helping customers to start, run and sustainably grow their businesses.
“This program gives business leaders a framework to practically scale their businesses,” Ms Stewart said. “We think it is important to not only provide traditional banking services but also the essential knowledge that helps our customers expand and grow.”On an aggregated basis, graduates had increased revenue by 374 per cent, profits by 461 per cent and added over 1300 jobs, the bank said.
