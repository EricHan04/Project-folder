Think printed history only comes in books or photographs?
Well, Springton Primary School students have shown that it can be made, too.
Students have designed and created objects using Makers Empire software and a 3D printer to help bring to life the stories of children who attended the Friedensberg German School between 1861 and 1913.
The title 'Small Objects - Grosse Geschichte' translates as 'Small Objects - Big Stories'.
An exhibition of the items has been opened at the Friedensberg German School Museum on May 31 for History Month.
The display will also be presented at a showcase event attended by other schools in Adelaide later this month.
This project follows on from students having designed models of artefacts or structures associated with WWI which formed part of an Anzac Day display which was on show at the Mount Pleasant Soldier's Memorial Hall during this year's commemoration.
The tasks have helped form strong connections between the lives of students today, and, with empathy and a greater understanding of, events in the past.
The school has been participating in the innovative partnership program with the Friedensberg German School Museum, History SA and Makers Empire.
