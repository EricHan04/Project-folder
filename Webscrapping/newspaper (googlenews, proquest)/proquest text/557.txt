Waikerie 76, Renmark RSL 69, Lyrup 62 , Loxton 56 and Barmera 48 follow. But Renmark did not have it all its own way on Wednesday against bottom side Barmera, winning 61-53 thanks mainly to Chrissy Eagle’s rink winning 24-14 from Gloria Burns. Berri took out all three rinks in beating Waikerie 79-46, while Renmark RSL won from Lyrup 3-0, 61-48.
In the triples competition, also played last Wednesday, Renmark RSL White surged to the top of the ladder with a 91-68 win against Monash.
Rinks were shared 2-2 but victories by the Mirco DeCol and Mal Inglis rinks, 28-14 and 31-6, took the RSL side to the win. Renmark Gold sits just two points behind in second spot after beating Berri Red 82-74 and Waikerie is fourth after a 96-72 win over Loxton Blue. Bill Haby’s rink won 27-14 against Dave Thomson.
CRICKET THE Berri club is planning a reunion from Friday to Sunday, February 23-25, and is inviting all past players, officials and supporters.
Interest in the game in the Riverland has taken a definite downturn in recent years, as with a number of summer sports, and the Berri club has not escaped the decline.
However, RTCA president Brian Lynch and his committee, in conjunction with member clubs, are working hard to rekindle interest in the sport at junior and senior levels.
For Berri at its reunion, there will be much to celebrate, as it boasts a phenomenal history. Friday night will involve a catch-up cricket match at the Berri oval and Saturday night a dinner at the Berri Hotel.
On Sunday morning, there will be a visit to the grandstand, a place where many a celebration has been held over the years, for breakfast.
Contacts are Doc Clifford 0429 030 284, Doug Stewart 0428 823 634 or Peter Safralidis 0412 040 778.
