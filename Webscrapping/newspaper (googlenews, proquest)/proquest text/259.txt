THE head of supermarkets giant Woolworths has told the Australian business community to quit "navel gazing" on the issue of climate change and join the fight to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
"You can do a lot of talking and do a lot of navel gazing if you want to," chief executive Michael Luscombe told delegates at the Environment Business Australia Forum in Sydney yesterday.
"But my advice to companies is just get out there and do it. You might not get it all right, but you will learn a hell of a lot along the way."
Mr Luscombe was taking part in a panel discussion with business leaders at the forum to highlight ways companies can address global warming.
The panel, which included executives from energy retailer Elgas, greenhouse solutions business Energetics, Investa Property Group and think tank Environment Business Australia (EBA), agreed that cutting greenhouse gas output would reduce waste and save money.
Mr Luscombe said Woolworths' "green journey" began about 18 months ago and it recently employed a sustainability expert and set up an independent advisory board to make sure the retailing giant hits its targets.
Mr Luscombe said goals include zero landfill impact, lower water usage, more efficient transport and minimising its overall carbon dioxide footprint.
"In 2006, our carbon footprint was 3.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent . . . and a big chunk of that was around refrigeration, air conditioning and lighting," he said.
He said Australia's biggest retailer would eventually like to recycle everything coming out of its 800 stores.
