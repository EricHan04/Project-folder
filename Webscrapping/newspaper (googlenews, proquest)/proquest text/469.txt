PAKISTAN yesterday submitted another lacklustre performance, this time in the field, as Western Australia marched towards a first innings lead at the WACA Ground.
After looking shaky at 3/84, WA advanced to 3/226 approaching tea on the second day of the four-day tour match.
WA vice-captain Mike Hussey reminded Australian selectors of his worth with an unbeaten 95, while fellow Australia A batsman Marcus North was not out 69.
The pair shared in an unbroken 148-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Hussey was particularly strong square of the wicket as the Pakistani attack continually pitched short on a pacy, but demon- less, WACA pitch.
He brought up his 50 by hammering off-spinner Shoaib Malik to the midwicket fence just before lunch.
The 29-year-old lifted the tempo before tea, taking 15 off one Abdul Razzaq over.
Fast bowling pair Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami generally disappointed on a pitch that is becoming flatter by the session. Shoaib was used in short spells of three, five and four overs.
The world's fastest bowler failed to generate the speed and venom he is renowned for.
