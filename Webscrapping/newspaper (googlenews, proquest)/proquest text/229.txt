THE search is on for the country’s best innovators in the mining, resources, energy, space and defence industries.
CORE Innovation Hub, a collaboration and innovation hub focused on the resources industry operating in Western Australia and South Australia, has launched its inaugural CORE Hot 30 Awards.
The award winners will be announced as part of CORE Exchange 2020, a national virtual conference and technology showcase on December 3.
CORE’s national innovation hub manager, Renee Hakendorf, said it was time the most ingenious businesses within the sectors, which could influence innovation in the resources ecosystem were recognised and celebrated on the national stage.
“Many of these organisations often go about their businesses quietly,” she said. “By identifying the sectors’ businesses that are developing new technologies, transforming industry practices or even taking their products and services to new international markets, we’ll be giving them a platform and highlight their great initiatives.” Applications for CORE Hot 30 Awards are open to Australian businesses via the corehub.com.au website until midnight on November 1.
