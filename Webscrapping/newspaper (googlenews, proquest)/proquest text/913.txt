NEW tenants for the old Mitsubishi site at Tonsley will soon be announced to join teaching and manufacturing operations already located there, Jay Weatherill says.
The Premier yesterday opened the new Tonsley TAFE on the site, a $120 million development consolidating existing campuses from Marleston, O'Halloran Hill and Panorama. Those sites will be shut down.
In December, the State Government said it would reap millions of dollars from the sales of the redundant TAFE sites and developers were keen to get hold of the land.
The Tonsley site is home to the taxpayer-funded TAFE and Flinders University campus, with Siemens to spend $5 million to relocate there and ICT company Tier 5 to spend $110 million to set up on the site.
The Opposition has criticised the Government for allocating large areas of the site to housing rather than commercial tenants.Mr Weatherill insisted the site would "become an exciting, innovative advanced manufacturing hub", saying he was in "advanced" discussions with other private operators.
