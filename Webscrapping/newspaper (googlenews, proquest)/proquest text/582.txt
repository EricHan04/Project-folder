READY Steady Go Kids has opened a northern suburbs branch of its ever-popular multi-sport program for pre-schoolers.
The classes, run in Surrey Downs, are great news for children living in the immediate area and surrounding suburbs.
Run by experienced and highly-trained instructors, Ready Steady Go Kids is Australia's largest program of its kind.
At a time when childhood obesity is a very real problem for Australian children, it is a great way to promote a healthy lifestyle from an early age.
The program teaches children from 2 1/2 to six years the fundamentals of ten sports in a social, non-competitive environment.
Surrey Downs sessions of the program designed by physiotherapists will be on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday mornings in Term 1.
"We're looking forward to welcoming children from all around the northern suburbs," Ready Steady Go Kids director Stuart Derbyshire said.
"We currently run classes at 11 other locations throughout Adelaide, but there is definitely a demand for the program in suburbs like Golden Grove."
