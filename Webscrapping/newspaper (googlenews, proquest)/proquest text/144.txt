THE $200,000 Hamilton Space School at Hamilton Secondary College, with a simulated Martian crater and landscape, mission control room and briefing room, will be officially opened by Education Minister Susan Close tonight.
Astronauts Andy Thomas and Pam Melroy, and other space industry experts here for the 68th International Aeronautical Congress, also will attend. As revealed by The Advertiser last year, students can role-play missions with teams of astronauts collecting samples on the Mars surface, and scientists monitoring data and problem solving in the control room.
The Martian landscape is built from rocks from across Australia to map out seven different geological areas.
An outreach program will allow other schools to use the centre. Principal Peta Kourbelis said the space school “provides an authentic experience for students who will be able to participate in activities like communicating with astronauts in real time and use the very latest software”.The control room will also be used to Skype with astronauts from NASA.
