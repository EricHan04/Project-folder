NORWOOD-based company SMAC Technologies has been named the state's 2012 CleverGreen Innovator to Watch for its airconditioning system that claims to save energy and improve cooling efficiency by up to half.
The company took home the top prize - which was announced yesterday as part of the ENVIRO 2012 conference.
SMAC uses an optimised solution by which outside air is pre-treated through a de-humidification coil and cooled with chilled water before contacting the inside air. The return air is treated by a second coil, which provides more efficient cooling.
Intelligent Software Development and Azzo were the other finalists recognised last night.
SMAC received a cash prize of $3000, while the finalists got $1500 each.
