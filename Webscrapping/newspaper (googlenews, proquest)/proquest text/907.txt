1 JUST three of the seven have raced and all are maidens. TASSOLOGY (6) has the best of the exposed form with a debut third to unbeaten Augusta Proud at Moonee Valley. The watch runners are obviously the unraced. None has trialled. MINNESOTA SHARK (2) by Lonhro from the top mare Ponton Flyer, who has a winning family, is the pick on breeding.
ON-PACERS: Insufficient exposed form.
SWOOPERS: Insufficient exposed form.
SUGGESTED BET: Nil.
2 This looks a tricky race with at least five of seven runners with claims. The consistent ARBITRATION (1) and emerging GALLOPIN (2) might be the pick of them. In a race of little obvious speed, Gallopin should be in the first three from his rails draw. He has a win over the distance range and 3.5kg weight edge which may give him a slight edge. Gallopin worried ROAD TO ATHENS (5) out of a win last start at Moonee Valley. Stablemate MOJO PIN (4) was shuffled back at a crucial stage at Caulfield last week before running on fairly. ROSLOTTA (6), on trial at the trip, got well back in a fast run race at the Valley, but was handy to the pace in the Ararat Cup at his previous run.
ON-PACERS: Roslotta.
SWOOPERS: Arbitration, Gallopin, Mojo Pin, Road To Athens.
SUGGESTED BET: Gallopin straight out.
3 The pace is the key to this open race. LAURA'S CHARM (1) is a top class mare suspect at 1600m. The slow pace played into her hands last time at Moonee Valley. With JUST CURIOUS (2), a specialist this trip, and MYALANSKY (4) noted on-pacers, there should be more pace on here. PRINCESS MARIZZA (3) has a 3kg weight swing over Laura's Charm and, given a solid tempo, can reverse the result. Blinkers go on and she needs room so the wide draw suits. TAHNEE TANGO (5) drops back in distance but will appreciate the return to mares' grade and PARTIVA (6), who chased home Laura's Charm at Moonee Valley and gets a 2kg weight swing, are consistent and racing well.
ON-PACERS: Just Curious, Myalansky.
SWOOPERS: Laura's Charm, Princess Marizza, Tahnee Tango, Partiva.
SUGGESTED BET: Box quinellas 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
4 ANAVALANCHE (5) worked to the line well last week after being forced to change course in the straight, indicating the extra 200m will suit. He was taken out of an easier race last night at Moonee Valley. I'M A TOFF (2) chased the leader and winner Super Gains in the same race and stuck to his task gamely. WILSONS PROMONTORY (1) found the 1200m too short at Moonee Valley but ran on well and if he can settle is a genuine threat.
ON-PACERS: I'm A Toff, Validator.
SWOOPERS: Wilsons Promontory, Viking Turf Belle, Anavalanche, Shesha.
SUGGESTED BET: Anavalanche each-way.
5 REDONDO BEACH (11) is an emerging stayer who was impressive winning a $40,000 restricted race in slow ground on Ballarat Cup day. He won on good ground at his previous start and this half- brother to El Segundo has found a very winnable race. CHINA CAUSEWAY (12) is another lightly raced stayer who ran fourth in the same race at Ballarat and has since won easily at Kyneton, also on his preferred soft ground. BILLYWING (5), bought as a jumper, has struck career-best form with Sandown and Moonee Valley restricted wins. He was scratched from an easier race at Moonee Valley last night for this. PANTANI (1) and VENGO (8), who ran an improved race last time, are on the Perth Cup trail.
ON-PACERS: Vengo.
SWOOPERS: Pantani, Expunge, You Sexy Boy, Don Raphael, Billy- wing, Redondo Beach, China Causeway.
SUGGESTED BET: Redondo Beach straight out.
6 SCENIC ASSAULT (5) looks well placed for a first-up win. He won at his first start after coming from Perth at this trip at Sandown on soft ground after a 49-day break. He handles all conditions and will race handy from the good draw. THREEDEE (3) is a smart galloper who indicated a win is near when he just failed at Geelong behind the consistent JUNGLE RULER (10) after staying on the rails, while other runners went wide on a soft track. His last win was at this track and trip. ITSAMONTY (7) will be running on strongly.
ON-PACERS: Scenic Assault, Jungle Ruler.
SWOOPERS: Ista Kareem, Stickpin, Threedee, Roadhog, Snort, Saratime, Bella Princess.
SUGGESTED BET: Scenic Assault straight out, quinellas with 2, 3, 7.
7 Adelaide visitor GRAND DUELS (9) was heavily backed but overraced when beaten in stakes class over 1200m last time but pulled up slightly lame after jarring up. He is unbeaten at the 1000m trip and will be looking to come off the pace set by MESSAGE BANK (2), PALACE GENERAL (4) and TOP TIER (5). Palace General is a smart sprinter resuming from injury problems. LA CHASSEUSE (11) is the in-form sprinter taking on open company for the first time. SATIN ROBES (3) can be forgiven for her career worst last at Sandown when she struck her head on the gates but the 56.5kg is a concern.
ON-PACERS: Message Bank, Palace General, Top Tier.
SWOOPERS: Apple Lode, Satin Robes, Bold Kel, Grand Duels, La Chasseuse.
SUGGESTED BET: Grand Duels each-way.
8 SHARKBITE (4) is on trial at the 1700m but he's a better class than these, drawn to be in the first two and has been kept up to the mark since his last run 28 days ago with a Cranbourne 1400m trial win. KING JOHANNES (3) is racing extra well. POISED TO WIN (5) is a last-start Ararat China Bowl winner when he had the rails; this time he has the outside draw. JIM'S PARTY (2) is a last-start stakes winner in Adelaide and has a good record at this distance range. ITSTHEONE (7) is consistent.
ON-PACERS: Sharkbite, Macau Causeway.
SWOOPERS: Jim's Party, King Johannes, Poised To Win, Itstheone.
SUGGESTED BET: Sharkbite each-way.
