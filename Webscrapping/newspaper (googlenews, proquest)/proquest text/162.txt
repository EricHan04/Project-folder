JUST as horses across Australia celebrate a collective birthday on August 1, Victoria's Marcus Oldham College has displayed perfect timing to promote a course devoted to equine management.
Marcus Oldham's Diploma of Equine Management promises to equip "ambitious and determined graduates" with the business foundations, horse husbandry and science knowledge they will need to shine.
The course, which offers an intensive year of practical and theoretical learning, has won international recognition, a spokesman said.
It encompasses a range of key subject areas including equine science, young horse education and training, yearling preparation, breeding practices, nutrition, business management and exercise physiology.
It could deliver employment opportunities in such fields as stud management, riding coach, Thoroughbred or Standardbred training, auctioneering, pedigree analysts, bloodstock agent, race club or breed society administration and horse dentistry.
Victorian trainer Henry Dwyer, a graduate of Marcus Oldham's class of 2007, said the course was of enormous benefit.
"Knowledge wise and learning wise it was really interesting," Mr Dwyer said.
"It formalised what you learn on the job when working in the stables and I would definitely recommend it to anyone out there who wanted to find a pathway in the industry. It is school with work in the classroom but it's also broken up with the practical side where you are out in the field, in the paddocks, at the racetrack and there are visits to studs and stables. I got a lot from it."
