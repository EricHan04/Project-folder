This involves building relationships with the aim of supporting young people in entrepreneurship. As head workforce planner at Workforce BluePrint, I work across a variety of industry sectors to identify future workforce requirements.
QUALIFICATIONS I hold a Master of Education, Graduate Diploma in Management (Learning), Advanced Diploma of Management, Diploma of Training and Assessment, Certificate IV in Training and Assessment, and a Certificate IV in Small Business Management WHERE I STARTED My first job (aged 14) was birthday party co-ordinator at Hungry Jack's. It taught me how to get along with anybody. I believe it's important for young people to get experience and be encouraged to be enterprising.
MY TIPS TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY Whether it's in workforce planning or entrepreneurship, the best tip is to get practical experience and build credibility.
WHY I CHOOSE TO WORKIN SOUTH AUSTRALIA I regularly travel but South Australia is where my family and my heart is. I live in the southern Adelaide foothills and I love the Fleurieu Peninsula.The entrepreneurial ecosystem in Adelaide and the support for innovation across the state is unprecedented and that's why I'm VIP Boss and founder of BO$$ Camp. This new initiative for 14 to 18-year-olds was born at Startup Adelaide in 2014 and we have launched nationally.
