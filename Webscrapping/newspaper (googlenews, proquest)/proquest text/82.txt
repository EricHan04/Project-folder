THE principal of Wilderness School, one of South Australia’s highest-profile independent schools, has resigned after 16 years.
Jane Danvers, who also is president of the SACE Board and chairwoman of the Jam Factory, is taking up a role at a girls’ school in Sydney, where her twin daughters live.
Ms Danvers, pictured, said she was proud of the educational direction at Wilderness, an all-girls school.
“It’s about preparing young women for their professional lives and their future,” she said.
“I love the quote which says we should be educating children for their future and not our past. That’s been the mantra and for young women, in particular, the world is full of new opportunities.” Ms Danvers will move to Kambala, an all-girls’ school at Rose Bay, Sydney. She will continue at Wilderness and the SACE Board until the end of the year. She also serves on the Andy Thomas Space Foundation education advisory board.
