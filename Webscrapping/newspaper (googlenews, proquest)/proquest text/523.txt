ADELAIDE, Nov 17 AAP - Spin twins Daniel Cullen and Cullen Bailey shared three first session wickets between them to keep South Australia on track for an outright win over Western Australia at lunch on the final day of the Pura Cup match at Adelaide Oval today.
WA struggled to 5-128 at the interval, a long way from the 401 required to win.
Overnight batsmen Chris Rogers and Adam Voges survived the day's first hour, Voges striking a series of authoritative strokes.
Rogers, however, was not as comfortable and soon after drinks he miscued Cullen's off break to mid on where Jason Gillespie juggled the catch.
Voges looked secure before he was outthought by Cullen and SA skipper Darren Lehmann, who returned to action today after recovering from dehydration.
Lehmann posted himself at very short mid on and Voges obliged by flicking Cullen straight at him to depart for 76 when a hundred beckoned.
Wrist spinner Bailey gained sharp, quick spin and artfully fooled David Bandy near lunch.
Bandy was beaten by a series of flighted leg breaks then played fatally back to a flatter, straighter ball to be very lbw.
