We know we're lucky to call Sydney home, but we pay a high price to live in the nation's most vibrant city. Jeni Porter and Lisa Pryor crunch the numbers.
Nell is a 28-year-old artist whose existence is as economical as her name. That's N E L L, four letters and nothing else. Her total income is just as small - about $20,000, or less than half the average wage.
She's a success story, with a piece exhibited at the Art Gallery of NSW and the backing of a major commercial dealer, but she needs to top up the $15,000 she earned last year with social security. The payment on the East Sydney studio she lives and works in has doubled in six years. What little is left after the $125-a-week rent goes on her art and survival.
"My philosophy is I claim it on my tax or I eat it," she says.
Last summer Nell made a sculpture that cost her $8000, the sort of money that other people her age might use to buy a car or save towards a house deposit. Nell says if she was in it for the money she would have studied law or something. She thinks she gets enough to have a "magical life".
Others get an awful lot more and think it's not enough. When James Packer was luring Peter Yates away from his beloved Melbourne to Sydney to run the Packer's media empire, one of the enticements was an interest-free $6 million housing loan.
It was based on a rough guess that Yates would have to spend twice what his Hawthorn home was worth to get the equivalent here. He bought a five-bedroom home with a 1200-bottle, climate-controlled wine cellar for $5.85 million in Bellevue Hill, just around the corner from his boss, Kerry Packer. It's a spectacular amount of money. But Yates has said privately that he believes three times the Hawthorn house would have been closer to the mark. Even then there are lots of things that he can't replicate about his old locale versus the new one in the eastern suburbs.
Yates was moving from one job at the stratospheric end of the salary scale to another. His base salary as chief executive of Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd is $2.1 million, he's got a share deal potentially worth millions, and the $360,000 odd of annual interest he saves is the equivalent of about 7.5 times what most Sydneysiders earn.
Yates would not comment publicly on his lifestyle musings. Suffice to say they are not a cry for poverty. They are just an extreme example of the sort of evaluation that goes on when people weigh up why they live here. Nell does the same thing, especially after an exodus of artist friends to Melbourne where studio rentals are much cheaper. The evaluation is one that can be applied to Sydney as a whole. Are we getting enough? Are we as well paid as the rest of Australia thinks? Do the benefits of living here outweigh the sacrifices? We know our housing costs are the nation's highest, but what about other costs of living? Is Sydney Australia's high-cost capital?
When you've really made it in Sydney your salary is more likely to be benchmarked against your peers in Hong Kong or New York than Melbourne or Perth. This is Sydney, the international city, where the players in banking, finance, law or major industries are on the world circuit. It was the home of half of the 20 highest paid executives in Australian public companies last year. They earned between $3.34 million and $11.9 million from running financial, property or industrial companies. It is also where the likes of Macquarie Bank can earn the moniker of the "millionaires' factory" for the scores of executives who crack seven figures through its high-performance linked salaries and share scheme.
While Sydney's two biggest earners last year were Frank Lowy, the founder of Westfield Holdings, and Wal King, who runs the property group Leighton Holdings, Macquarie has made more staff more wealthy than their respective organisations. In the year to March 2003 it spent just over half its total revenue of $1.89 billion on employment expenses. This works out to a huge $202,000 a head for each of its 4802 staff. Last year 13 executives took home more than $1 million apiece.
We know all of this because of much more onerous public company disclosure rules. Every year key executives' deals in public companies are laid bare: the base salary, the perks, the share scheme, the super, and just lately the extreme dollars that a few people are being paid - more often to stop than pass go.
They tend to create a mythology about how much people earn, especially in Sydney, where most of the big jobs are. Tax Office statistics for the latest year show that you have a slightly higher chance of making $1 million or more in NSW than elsewhere. But the 1137 people who reported those incomes in 2000 represented only 0.03 per cent of the state's total 3.37 million taxpayers.
When it's all averaged out, Sydneysiders are not the best-paid people in the country. According to Roy Morgan Research the residents of Canberra come in at number one with 30 per cent of full-time workers earning $50,000 or more, versus Sydney's 19 per cent and the national average of 15 per cent. There's even more of a gap at $70,000-plus with 16 per cent of full-time workers in the ACT compared with 9 per cent in Sydney and 6.2 per cent nationwide.
Bruno Cecchini, principal of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, says there's an intuitive idea that people in Sydney are paid more, but it doesn't come through in any of his firm's surveys. Senior executives and professionals tend to operate in a national market, partly because they work for larger organisations that operate on national scales, so there might be a difference of 2 or 3 per cent across the country.
And, according to Stephen Moir, who runs the recruitment firm Michael Page International, between Sydney and Melbourne "there's not much difference, full stop". "Accounting, legal, human resources, IT - it really doesn't vary that much." Moir says that in some roles there might be $5000 to $10,000 more on a $100,000 job paid in Sydney than Melbourne.
The gaps are wider between Sydney and other cities but the smaller places such as Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth don't offer anything like the choice of jobs. But Cecchini says that lower down the scales there are some trade jobs and graduate roles that show marked differences between cities because of skill shortages and local demands. He also says that there are more pronounced differences in certain sectors where Sydney is tops.
"It's the financial hub of Australia: most of the large institutions are there; funds management and investment banking are very heavily Sydney-oriented." Cecchini says this means they lead the market in pay rates but some Melbourne firms have been forced to match them to lure people to the southern city. Other jobs that attract a premium in NSW are finance managers, specialist accountants, and some senior sales and marketing roles.
Cecchini says clients are saying that the legal profession is "unusually buoyant with substantial pay increases because they are struggling to get people at the rates they want to pay". A NSW Law Society profile of solicitors shows that 16 per cent earned $75,000 to $100,000 in 2001 versus 13 per cent two years before, and 15 per cent earned $150,000 plus versus 12 per cent in 1999. But incomes have dropped at the highest echelons of the major city firms. An industry source says that whereas the senior partners have made $1 million or more previously, they are more likely to be getting about $700,000 to $750,000 now.
A professor in a leading university earns about one seventh of that. Rory Hume, who took over as vice-chancellor of the University of NSW last year, wants to hire the best people so he has set out to pay the top salaries in the sector.
As an opening gambit in the three-year enterprise bargaining round, Hume offered salary increases of 15-19 per cent over three years, including a one-off payment to everyone of $3000 that was partly to reflect the higher cost of living in Sydney. The deal is still under negotiation because the union is holding out for 36 weeks' paid maternity leave. Hume has said 14 weeks is tops - that's more than twice the standard six weeks offered in the private sector. Universities also have generous superannuation schemes and leave allowances that mean you can't make direct dollar comparisons on salaries.
UNSW is part of what Craig Shepherd, the principal economist of the think tank National Economics, has dubbed Global Sydney. This is the go-go place with only 350,000 jobs, or a fifth of Sydney's total, but all the firepower. Shepherd says Global Sydney starts at Ryde, weaves its way down the Warringah Freeway to North Sydney, sweeps over the bridge through the Central Business District and then spreads out to the eastern suburbs and south to Port Botany.
The CBD core is full of bankers, lawyers and accountants, while the creatives - advertising, computing, media, academics - work nearer the edges. People make sacrifices to work here - they take on much bigger mortgages, they commute much more than they would in other cities, they spend more on living. But Shepherd thinks there's as much if not more of a sacrifice in staying away.
"If you don't come there's an enormous sacrifice of missing the opportunity of reaching your highest capacity," says the nevertheless Melbourne-based Shepherd.
"The opportunity is there and it's become really obvious that the opportunities are not in other places." And, he says, this does not just apply to middle-aged people at the peaks of their careers. "Young people really choose to be in Global Sydney. That's the only place where they are earning big money as well."
By Shepherd's reckoning, those in the 15-to-34 age group can and do earn five or six times more than their peers elsewhere. Close to 30 per cent of people in that age group earned more than $50,000 last year versus a national average of 10 per cent. "If you are a smart young person in Wollongong with a degree you could stay there and earn a maximum of about $50,000. But if you went to Sydney - who knows?"
Older people also have much higher incomes in Global Sydney, with 15.7 per cent of over 55s earning more than $50,000 versus a national average of 6.4 per cent.
Paul Long, 50, earns $200,000-plus as executive general manager of United People, a division of the North Sydney-based construction and engineering firm United Group. He's never had a job he disliked and can imagine himself working for a lot longer. "At 50, do you really want to slow down? I'm more than overjoyed with the challenges put in front of me," he says. After much soul searching, Long and his wife and young son moved to Sydney from Perth two years ago. He wishes he'd come here long ago and would have changed his mining-oriented career path to do so. "If I knew that Sydney was as vibrant and enjoyable to live in I would have moved here 20 years ago."
Long's thoughts are echoed by Ant Rainger, team leader at advertising agency Publicis Mojo. Having moved his wife, three kids and dog from Auckland two years ago, Rainger knows full well the shock of the different costs of living here. Housing hit them the hardest but there's much more. "We so, so underestimated it," he says.
Rainger thinks it means that people, particularly once they have families, are continuously re-evaluating. "I don't think it's a set and forget town unless you have lived here forever ... we have looked at Melbourne as well. There's no question there's a quality of lifestyle, convenience and ease there but the flipside is that Sydney is a big exciting city."
Rainger says that despite the higher costs, persuading people to come here "is an easy sell". "There's a kudos factor - Sydney is the main stage in Australia for advertising, and a launching pad elsewhere. A capable copywriter in Brisbane might make some significant financial sacrifices to come to Sydney but they're coming to the main game. What the city does offer is the potential to be 250 per cent better off."
While Sydneysiders may not be the biggest average earners they are irrefutably the most burdened by housing costs, irrespective of whether they own or rent.
The Sydney Swans have put a price on living in Sydney and they reckon you need 15 per cent more just to be on a par with Melburnians. The Swans have had the 15 per cent top-up built into their capped salaries for more than a decade, says director of football Andrew Ireland. It is meant to compensate players for extra housing costs here and was introduced to help Sydney induce players to move interstate.
But the vocal Melbourne-based president of Essendon, Graeme McMahon, and Collingwood's Eddie McGuire want it scrapped, claiming it puts their clubs at a disadvantage. The talks have been going on for months.
Ireland says the Swans argue that "while the fundamental difference is housing, it goes further than that". But the AFL stipulates that only the portion of a player's income that goes on housing should have the Sydney loading.
The Swans are still crunching the numbers but Ireland says it works out roughly like this: If about 35 per cent of income goes on housing expenses and the cost of renting or owning is about 35 per cent more in Sydney than Melbourne, the differential is 12.25 per cent.
Other analysis suggests the cost differential between the two cities is much higher than 35 per cent. An assessment of rentals for apartments and houses in affluent suburbs in Australia's main cities by Mercer rates Sydney as 55 per cent more expensive than Melbourne, twice Brisbane, and 125 per cent above Canberra.
According to research produced by the Real Estate Institute of Australia and AMP, home loan affordability in NSW is the lowest it's been since 1996 thanks to runaway house prices. At the end of last year the median house price in NSW was $450,000, or 34 per cent higher than Melbourne and 83 per cent above Canberra. The average Sydney family has a mortgage of $214,602 and spends 31.8 per cent of the weekly income on it, just above what is technically called the stress level. By comparison Victorians spend about 27 per cent of their weekly income on their $184,656 average mortgage. Canberra clocks in at only 16.1 per cent thanks to lower house prices and higher incomes.
The REIA/AMP research, which measures weekly family incomes, ranks Sydney at fourth behind ACT, Northern Territory and Victoria. Ireland says the Swans players have added costs because they need to live near the Sydney Cricket Ground, where they train every day. This pushes them into the most expensive part of the Sydney housing market.
He knows the experience first-hand, having shifted with his partner from Brisbane last October. "I'm really happy where I'm living [an apartment in the historic Astor building in Macquarie Street] but it's costing me an arm and a leg."
Ireland says someone like 18-year-old Adam Schneider, who as a second-year player earns about $47,000, has found it hard here. Schneider, who has broken into the senior side, is on record saying that if it wasn't for the money he gets from match payments he would have gone backwards to the tune of about $3,000 this year. Still, if you want to earn a living kicking a footy you can't stay in Wagga Wagga.
Others have more of a choice and it often holds them back from moving here. Most companies will cover the cost of moving, some even pay stamp duty on a purchase, but very few provide free finance like the Packers' PBL.
Housing costs terrify people, says Richard Leupen, the managing director of United Group, the firm that brought Long to Sydney. Leupen says: "We move people around quite a bit between states and this is invariably the issue." In his firm Sydney wages are about 20 to 25 per cent above the lower-cost cities such as Adelaide and Perth, and much closer to Melbourne's.
Leupen says there are two major considerations - the size of Sydney and the costs of equivalent housing. To keep their mortgages under control people end up a long way out and spend a lot of time travelling. Or they take on a huge mortgage to maintain their living standards and then worry about their job security.
"There's people that I would like to have here who won't come because they won't take on the burden. It does become a barrier; most people really enjoy Sydney as a city."
While it is expensive to start out in the property market here, for those established in Sydney the rampant growth in prices has underpinned significant growth in their net worth. NSW has the highest average wealth in the country largely thanks to house prices. And that's made us big spenders.
"We're buying more and more each year," says Craig James, a senior analyst with CommSec. He calculates that each person in NSW spent an average $2260 at retail outlets in the first three months of this year, or about 5 per cent more than a year ago.
All up, people in NSW accounted for about $15.2 billion of the $43.6 billion spent nationally in the March quarter this year. James says the growth rate really took off close to three years ago and is well above the longer-term average annual growth rate of 3.8 per cent.
For some analysts spending patterns are a better way of measuring overall economic wellbeing than average earnings. On that count NSW is in fine shape.
James says this rise and rise of spending has been driven by the generally strong economy, stronger labour market and a housing market on fire. "People are spending up big on housing-related items such as hardware for renovations or appliances," he says.
While the spending is being driven by greater wealth Sydney also clocks in as the most expensive city - even with housing removed from the equation - according to Mercer. Some of this is a direct spin-off of the high property costs. Rentals are higher so they flow through to things like restaurant prices, or parking.
Based on a twice yearly survey of the prices of about 200 goods and services, Mercer rates Sydney as 3 per cent more expensive than Melbourne, 8 per cent above Brisbane, 14 per cent over Canberra and 10 per cent above Darwin.
Mercer calculates that a person earning $100,000 a year has a "spendable" sum of $28,677. If they moved from Canberra to Sydney their cost of living would rise by $4015.
Darwin had the honour of being deemed Australia's most expensive city in 1999, the last time the Australian Bureau of Statistics did its five-yearly household expenditure survey. Apart from housing, which is dirt cheap, pretty much everything else is expensive because it is so remote.
This survey showed that Sydneysiders spent an average $44.36 a week on eating out and fast foods versus $40.20 in Melbourne and $43.65 in Canberra. Dry-cleaning averaged $1.03 a week in Sydney and 82 cents in Melbourne. Big jobs and big expenses are related, says lawyer Gabrielle McKinnon. She halved her salary when she gave up her job as intellectual property lawyer at the city firm Freehills to work at the Marrickville Legal Centre three years ago. But McKinnon also cut her costs.
"A lot of things I used to spend money on I don't have to any more, for example, expensive suits. There is less focus on status so it's easier to get by on less money." She walks to work from her home in Leichhardt and eats in a lot more.
"If you're working such long hours, often you have to spend a premium for other people to do things like dry-cleaning," she says. "You don't have time to make your own lunch; you eat dinner out a lot."
McKinnon found both jobs rewarding. A lower income means renting while friends buy houses, but she says she still has "a pretty good lifestyle".
Instead of being in the top salary bracket she's now sitting around the middle earning about the same money as a teacher. "I guess I feel I'm not in a position to complain about my income when a lot of people work really hard and are raising families on a lot less."

Profession: Artist
Lives: East Sydney
Income: $20,000
`Last year I did a stock-take of my possessions and I was mortified and pleased that I owned so little. Colourful trainers and vintage clothing are my luxuries. I like '40s and '50s dresses, everything from sun frocks to cocktail dresses. I have a membership at City Gym and go to yoga once or twice a week and that's a priority. I live on fruit. I buy $50 worth from Paddy's Market every week. When times are tough, even public transport is an absolute luxury. I walk everywhere, but it doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. I don't get holidays apart from my grants but my grants are fabulous. I'm going to Venice and Basel this year. The materials I use in my work can be expensive. In April I spent $1780 on a crocodile tail from a crocodile farm in far northern Queensland, to use in a sculpture.'
Paul Long, 50
Profession: Executive general manager of United People
Lives: McMahons Point
Income: $200,000 plus
`Prior to coming to Sydney from Perth, I'd been mortgage-free for a while. Now the vast majority of the money goes on the mortgage on the family home in McMahons Point, where I live with my wife and my nine-year-old son. My office is in North Sydney and I can walk to work so we just have one car, a Saab Convertible. We live in an area where we can walk to many cafes and restaurants in Blues Point Road where we eat out probably once a week. We have gym memberships and also annual memberships for the North Sydney Olympic Pool where we spend a significant part of our early mornings. We like to go to the theatre, the opportunities are far greater than in Perth. We probably take two or three short holidays a year. We're planning a drive down to the skifields. I have brothers the same age in England and there's no competition - the lifestyle you can afford here is much better.'
Clare & Ian Alexander, both 32, charlotte, 2, finnian, 4
Professions: Ian is a retail category manager for Pfizer Australia Consumer Healthcare. Clare is a stay-at-home mum who also runs a small artist management business from home.
Live: Gladesville
Income: Over $100,000
Clare says: `Stay-at-home mums are a dying breed. For me, to go out and earn $100 means missing out on 10 hours with the kids and I'd rather have the time. We're passionate about travelling and we want to instil in our children a sense of adventure. This year we went to Bali and we ski every year. Ian surfs and does mountain bike-riding, so there's always something sporting we have to buy - wetsuits, water bottles. We also spend money on DIY. Ian has built all the children's furniture since they were born. We also spend money on family entertainment - The Lion King is coming to Sydney so we've pre-purchased tickets. And we like to support local restaurants, usually Indian or Thai. It's great for children because it gets them tasting different things.'
Lindsay Mcintyre, 29
Profession: Firefighter
Lives: Alexandria
Income: $44,500
`I've only been in the city for 18 months and it's a heap more expensive. In Armidale I paid $60 a week rent and here in Alexandria I pay $165. I like to spend my spare money on leisure activities. I'm a big Roosters fan so I go to as many games as I can and I play lawn bowls at the Alexandria Erskineville Bowling Club. I go out with friends to pubs like The Duke of Gloucester in Randwick. You start on the beers and then end up on the bourbons - they're about $5 a drink down here. And I'm a smoker, so that's expensive. I also go to concerts. Pearl Jam was the latest one. That was $85 a ticket and well worth it. Recently I bought a DVD player for $400, and I buy CDs. I try, where possible, to save up enough to fly back to Armidale to visit, which is about $350 return.'
