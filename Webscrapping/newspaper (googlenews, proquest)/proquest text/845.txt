WHEN business mentor Orren Prunckun organised an event for young entrepreneurs wanting to launch their businesses, he did not realise how many peoples' lives he would touch.
The 31-year-old ran Adelaide's first Startup Weekend in 2012 - a 54-hour event which assists participants create and launch web and mobile businesses.
Following its success, Prunckun and his two business partners established not-for-profit organisation Startup Adelaide Inc., which supports more than 500 entrepreneurs.
Mr Prunckun was recognised when he won Unley's Citizen of the Year Award."I was very surprised in fact, when I was asked to do a speech, I hadn't prepared anything in advance."
