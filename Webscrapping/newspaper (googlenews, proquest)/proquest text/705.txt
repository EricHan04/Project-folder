THE developer of the 2000-home Lightsview development at Northgate has been tasked with delivering housing at the Tonsley former Mistubishi site.
Canberra-based CIC Australia will develop an 11ha site at Tonsley, comprising shops, offices and housing for around 1200 people. CIC chief executive Col Alexander said the project would include a range of accommodation, including affordable housing.
"CIC has been developing in South Australia for the past 10 years and being chosen to partner with Renewal SA is another major achievement which reflects our ongoing commitment to the South Australian economy," he said.
"We will be working very closely with South Australia's building industry to deliver innovative design and housing products across the project." The Tonsley site was purchased by the State Government in 2010 as the site of a future "clean-tech hub".
The first major tenants to sign up to the precinct were a new super TAFE, Siemens, ICT company Tier 5 and Flinders University, which opened its new $120 million facility in January.
On Wednesday Basetec Services, Signostics Limited, Zen Industries and MAN Diesel and Turbo Australia also committed to establishing themselves at the $253 million advanced manufacturing hub.
The State Government will start work on a detailed masterplan for the residential precinct before entering a development deed later in the year.
Urban Development Minister Tom Koutsantonis said CIC had an outstanding record in innovative design, housing diversity and affordable housing.
He added: "The new Tonsley residential precinct will be home to about 1200 people with supporting retail and services."It is projected that the 61ha Tonsley site will employ a total of 6300 workers - and will accommodate 8500 students each year.
