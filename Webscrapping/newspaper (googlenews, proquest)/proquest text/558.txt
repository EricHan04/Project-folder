A BLOOD test could soon be used for early detection of stomach cancer, reducing the need for endoscopies, Australian researchers say.
A University of Adelaide team has identified four proteins that change in concentration in the blood of stomach cancer patients.
Associate Professor Peter Hoffmann said a blood test could be ready in three years.
"Using the four markers together produces high levels of selectivity and sensitivity in detecting stomach cancer," he said.
Researchers are now seeking a commercial partner to run clinical trials. The blood test would cost between $30-$50.Stomach or gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.
