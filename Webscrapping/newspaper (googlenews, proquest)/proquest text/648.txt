A REVOLUTIONARY pocket ultrasound, hailed as the stethoscope of the 21st century, has the potential to become South Australia's greatest medical invention.
The release of the new-age device from Adelaide company Signostics, is expected to open a $3.5 billion world market. In defiance of the gloom of the financial crisis, it is hoped Signostics can create jobs in Adelaide as it captures global sales.
The ultrasound was devised when brothers Stewart and Neil Bartlett combined their respective engineering and medical backgrounds.
Signostics chief executive Neil Bartlett developed the concept as a mature-age medical student when he became frustrated by the lack of suitable equipment.
Armed with a simple vision to put modern technology into every doctor's pocket, Dr Bartlett asked his brother to develop a tiny ultrasound device.
Almost 10 years later, their revolutionary ultrasound looms as a huge success.
Doctors have hailed it as the product of their dreams.
"People have had a vision for a visual stethoscope for a long time, but no one had done it until we came along," Mr Bartlett said.
"It needed some novel technology to make it work."
It had been positioned to be a personal device for physicians because it provided much more information than a stethoscope. Key attributes are its price - about $5000 compared with $20,000-plus for large, modern ultrasounds - plus portability and ease of use.
The hand-sized device has a wide variety of important medical uses, including emergency care to identify internal bleeding after trauma. Other important applications include physiotherapy, general practice, ambulance services and sports medicine.
Signostics, based at the BioSA Incubator in Thebarton, employs 24 people in Adelaide and six in the U.S.
