Alexandrina has announced the first wave of innovators who have been selected to compete in the 2021 Alexandrina Innovation Challenge Program starting in July.
The inaugural Innovation Challenge is set to accelerate the development of a leading entrepreneurial program for the creators, innovators and collaborators of the Alexandrina region.
This year's program has attracted an inspiring field of entries vying to create a more Liveable, Green and Connected Alexandrina, which is a key deliverable for the A2040 Community Strategic Plan.
The successful applicants will undergo a three month program to develop their idea and pitch to a panel of judges.
The program will be co-hosted with Startup Adelaide and will be looking to identify initiatives that are purpose-driven, innovative, scalable, sustainable, adaptable, future ready and environmentally aware.
This program will regenerate entrepreneurial capabilities and create new opportunities for growth, employment and collaboration, as to unmask new economic prospects for Alexandrina.
The following individuals and/or teams will be taking the Challenge this year: Ben Hewett and Will Miller, Vicki Mau and Steph Wheaton, Fiona Burrow, Kalani Bates, Harry Gaffney, Frances Rennell, Ben Kernahan, Ruth Mitchell, Chris Wilson.
Glenn Rappensberg, CEO, is excited to see the diversity and depth of entrants for this year's challenge.
"We have been blown away by the calibre and span of ideas led by passionate members of our community - we can't wait to share in their progress and celebrate our first inaugural winner," Mr Rappensberg said.
"For the Alexandrina region to thrive, we need to embrace home grown creativity and seek innovative solutions that create opportunities, which positively impact our environment, local economies and community wellbeing".
The Innovation Challenge will also be chaperoned by a team of local mentors and an internal support crew.
