Young students' design thinking and 3D printing skills were showcased at a statewide exhibition at the Adelaide Convention Centre last month.
Students from four local DECD primary schools - Goolwa, Victor Harbor, Port Elliot and Strathalbyn - had their work displayed with about 30 other schools as part of the Learning by Design: 3D Printing in Primary Schools Project on Thursday, July 5.
Lead teachers from each school engaged in 20 hours of professional development, learning new skills in design thinking and 3D printing using Makers Empire 3D software, developed by an Adelaide-based start-up company.
Teachers were encouraged to learn alongside their students and to model resilience when faced with challenges learning new skills. They worked with students to identify problems, brainstorm multiple design solutions, create and test prototypes and to seek feedback from their peers and broader communities.
Designs from local schools included barriers to stop sand from leaving sand pits, tourist information about local sites through QR codes, desk stationery organisers, devices to record computer passwords, and randomiser gadgets to select fitness activities amongst others.
The project "aims to support learning across the STEM disciplines by engaging students in exciting, challenging learning that is connected to their real-world experiences, and helping teachers to develop pedagogical approaches that enable students to develop deep technological knowledge combined with critical, creative and design thinking".
