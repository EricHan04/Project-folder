AN Adelaide school is taking entrepreneurial learning to a new level by inviting companies to base themselves on campus and inspire students.
Virtual-reality specialist Lateral Vision is the first to take up residence in Pembroke School’s new $25 million science, technology and art building for Years 7-10, opened last week.
The three-storey building, likely to soon have a helicopter suspended in its vast central atrium, has an “enterprise space” on each level so could potentially host three businesses at a time.
Siblings and former Pembroke boarders Laura and Alex Tolson co-founded Lateral Vision in 2014.
It creates virtual and augmented reality tours and training tools, and uses drones to make 360-degree videos.
“It’s a new model for everyone,” Ms Tolson, 31, said of the open-ended arrangement with the school.
“The intention is for the majority of the time we’ll be working on our projects for our clients. One of the main things is to open the school up to enterprise, bring the outside in and show students what the future of work is looking like.” Principal Luke Thomson said it was about “bringing the world into the school rather than chasing it”.“We thought ‘wouldn’t it be brilliant to have businesses allied to the area that’s being taught on that floor?’. What the students get to see is a functioning business,” Mr Thomson said.
