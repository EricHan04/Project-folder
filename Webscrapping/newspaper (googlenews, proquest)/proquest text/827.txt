LOOK, it's Sly and the family Stallone. Turns out actor Sylvester Stallone is also a fan of The Daily Edited, the global luxury-fashion brand co-founded by Adelaide's Alyce Tran.When Sly's daughters Scarlet, Sistine and Sophie, pictured with him, did a photo-shoot for their collaboration with TDE, The Expendables' star rocked up. "The girls were a dream to work with," Alyce says, adding: "I love how they support each other as sisters and it reminded me very much of how my sister (Carline Tran, who works in the fashion-mag biz) and I are with one another." Alyce says Sly was "a good sport", taking photos with everyone on set.
