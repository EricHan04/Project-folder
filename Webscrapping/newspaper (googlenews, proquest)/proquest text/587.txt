AFTER a year of unprecedented growth Adelaide based company Ready Steady Go Kids has hit another exciting milestone with the commencement of its first international franchise in Singapore.
The Singapore franchise was bought by businessman Wee Lee Chua, who couldn't be happier with the way the program has kicked off.
Mr Chua says he plans to grow the business rapidly to meet burgeoning demand.
His goal is to teach in 50 childcare centres and 20 independent locations across the city, with many of those classes starting by Term 1, 2013.
By offering the program at so many locations on a range of days and at a wide selection of times, Mr Chua hopes that all young children throughout Singapore will be able to benefit from the program.
"I want to help the nation build a sporting culture. It's one of the big things I love about Australia and Australians," Mr Chua said.
Physio-designed for children aged from two-and-a-half to six years, Ready Steady Go Kids aims to create positive attitudes to exercise that preschoolers will carry for life.
