ADELAIDE-BASED Signostics yesterday launched its hand-held ultrasound device - the Signos - in the European market.
Described as the world's smallest and most affordable portable ultrasound, the Signos will be introduced at the annual medical exhibition, MEDICA 2010, in Dusseldorf, Germany.
The company has received EU approval and plans to target the palliative care, respiratory and maternity sectors in Europe by expanding its global distribution network in 2011.
The exhibition featuring trends in medicine and patient care had 137,000 visitors from 100 countries last year.
The pocket-sized Signos retails for about $4000. It helps quicker diagnoses in hospitals, but also at remote sites.
Signostics chief executive Dr Neil Bartlett said he was looking forward to the feedback.
"Signos makes it cost-effective for individual physicians and hospitals to use ultrasound at the bedside," he said.
The company is eyeing a large slice of the global $3 billion personal ultrasound market.
