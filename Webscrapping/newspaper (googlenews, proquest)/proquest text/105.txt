WORLD-leading innovation comes to Adelaide roads – and the Adelaide Oval footbridge – this week as part of driverless shuttle trials during an international summit.
Representatives from the Australian and New Zealand Driverless Vehicle Initiative will meet in SA tomorrow ahead of the conference on Thursday and Friday.
“It’s basically a coalition of the willing – over 100 organisations – just trying to accelerate the safe representation of driverless technology on Australian roads,” said Professor Rocco Zito, who is part of the scientific research group at ADVI and head of civil engineering at Flinders University. Conference delegates will be offered rides around the Torrens in UK firm Aurrigo’s Pod Zero and French manufacturer Navya’s Arma and its counterpart EasyMile’s EZ10 shuttles, which are already part of trials elsewhere in Australia.
“Pod Zero will be programmed to run on the Adelaide Oval Bridge,” spokesman Roger van der Lee said.
“It’s exciting for us to showcase technology that will be in use at Tonsley later this month,” he said.Prof Zito said the conference builds on momentum created by the first public road test of driverless vehicle technology in 2015 with a modified Volvo on a closed Southern Expressway.
