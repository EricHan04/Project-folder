HAWTHORN has no fear of going to Perth in the last week of the AFL finals if that's the way the schedule falls, according to three-time premiership player Jarryd Roughead.
After Friday's shock 22-point loss to Port Adelaide, the Hawks are looking increasingly likely to have to travel interstate - and potentially twice to WA during the finals series.
But Roughead maintained the club's solid record in Perth and their win over West Coast a fortnight ago at Subiaco will hold them in good stead if that is what is required next month.
"There are two games to go (Brisbane Lions and Carlton) and all we can do is win (those games) and hope that the Eagles lose," Roughead said. "We'll just see how we go." Asked if there was concern about playing their first interstate final since 2010, Roughead was emphatic: "Obviously not, because we beat them (West Coast) a couple of weeks ago." The 28-year-old forward-ruckman said there was no cause for panic in the Hawthorn camp after the club's second loss in the past month, given the club had won 10 of their previous 11 matches before Friday. And he insisted the Hawks would learn from the loss.
"After the Richmond game, you were probably asking the same question, and we go across to Perth and win, and obviously we beat Geelong, too, so I don't think it is wear and tear," he said.
Hawks coach Alastair Clarkson had his team locked in a briefing room in the Etihad Stadium for more than 25 minutes after the match. But Roughead said it was a positive meeting about what lies ahead.
"(The message) was that (our key) indicators were down a fair bit and yet we still put ourselves into a position to be only a point down at three-quarter-time.
"But at the same time there were some positives that when the chips are down like that, and we are being beaten in the key performance indicators, we are still a chance (to be right in games)."We just had to play a bit of catch-up footy."
