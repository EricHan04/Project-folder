THE cornerstone tenant in the State Government's Tonsley advanced manufacturing hub has been placed in administration.
Tier 5, a company specialising in setting up data centres and associated services, was placed in administration on Thursday.
The company said in 2010 it planned to use up to 4500sq m of the Tonsley site and long-term plans were to build a $100 million "green" data centre.
The company was founded by IT entrepreneur Marty Gauvin, who built up and sold Adelaide hosting company Hostworks before branching out into this new venture.
KordaMentha has been put in place as administrator of the company. While Tier 5 was the flagship tenant at the Tonsley site, it has since attracted numerous other companies including Siemens, Hills, ZEN Energy Systems, Innovyz, Signostics, Basetec Services and MAN Diesel and Turbo.
The administrator will continue to run the company with a view to selling it.The company has 47 shareholders and debts in the order of $1.3 million to $1.5 million.
