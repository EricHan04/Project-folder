THE Olympics isn't the only big sporting news to come out of the UK this year.
Ready Steady Go Kids, Australia's largest multi-sport program for preschoolers, has just announced that it will commence operations next year in England.
Kathy and Matthew Bees are the latest franchisees to purchase an international franchise, after the program also expanded into Singapore earlier this year.
"We were looking for the right business opportunity," said the UK-based couple. "Ready Steady Go Kids came up in our internet search . . . and knew this was the program for us."
