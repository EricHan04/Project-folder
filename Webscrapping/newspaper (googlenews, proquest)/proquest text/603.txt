THE clock is ticking on expressions of interest to be lodged for a new manager for South Australia’s Venture Capital Fund, with bids due by September 17.
The right to manage the fund comes with a proviso – that existing manager Elaine Stead and her team be employed – so “right to manage” might be putting it a bit strongly. Rumour is there might be a few non-complying bids in the offing. In the meantime, the Fund has an interim manager, headed up by none other than UniSA alumnus and former Adelaidean Matt Fletcher.
Fletcher is founder and managing director of Melbourne-based MSC group, and coincidentally is the son of high profile Adelaide businessman Andrew Fletcher, pictured, the current chair of SA Water, former Economic Development Board member and former and Defence SA boss. Fletcher the younger’s CV speaks for itself.
MSC was founded in 2012, before which he was MD of Stanfield Securities, and he also has an MBA from the London School of Business and Finance. MSC has another local connection with head of compliance Shelley Brown, also an Adelaide expat.
Explaining its current role with the SAVCF, Fletcher said “During the interim period, MSC Trustees will separately engage Elaine Stead and her team under a temporary arrangement to ensure continuity and attention to existing investments held by SAVCF.
“We are delighted to assist the South Australian Government in taking this caretaker appointment and assisting transition of the South Australian Venture Capital Fund in readiness for the new manager appointment.”Fletcher said MSC now manages more than $1 billion of investor interests. Treasurer Rob Lucas said MSC Group was selected because its offer was well-priced and it was not seeking to submit a bid to run the fund longer-term.
