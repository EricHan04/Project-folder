ADELAIDE health start-up Personify Care has secured a Federal Government grant as it ramps up its push into the lucrative US market.
Personify, which secured close to $500,000, was one of 14 businesses chosen to share grants worth $7.4 million as part of the government’s Accelerating Commercialisation entrepreneurship program.
Personify Care chief executive Ken Saman said together with a capital raising from private investors, the funding would be used to accelerate its international expansion.
“There’s something quite special about growing a global company from Adelaide at the moment – our reputation as a healthcare tech hub is building,” he said.
Personify Care’s software allows nurses, specialist practices and hospitals to detect when a patient is at risk of a complication, and intervene.The technology was developed in Adelaide and trialled in SA private hospitals with the support of the TechInSA start-up accelerator.
