A ONE-ACT play written for a Year 12 drama class has won an Adelaide playwright a prestigious international prize that will see the work staged in London.
Sally Hardy's Gone Viral, which was orginally written for students at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College, has won the 2014 Trinity College of London International Playwriting Competition.
It tells the story of a 17-year-old girl dealing with the pressures of being a teenager while coming to terms with the impending death of her father.
The play will be part of a festival of one-act plays in May at the new St James Theatre in London's West End.
Hardy said she entered the competition after noticing that it was looking for one-act plays for teenage audiences.
"I specialise in writing for young people and I thought it was worth a shot," she said.
That was the last she thought of it until she received the email from Trinity College.
"It was well down my list, because I thought it was just to inform me who the winner was," she said. "When I opened the email I had to read it about five times before I decided to go out and tell my husband." Hardy wrote the play last year when a Year 12 drama class of girls couldn't find a suitable script to perform for an all-female cast. They took part in improvisational workshops, developing ideas which were woven in to the script.
As a Year 12 student, Hardy won South Australia's top prize for English Studies, the Tennyson Medal.
Her Trinity College prize includes cash towards travelling to London for the festival. Meanwhile, she is preparing for the Adelaide Fringe as writer and director of Hip Hop Hook and The Fairy Dust Fiasco, a family musical comedy.Staged by her company Free Range Theatrix, it is on at the Lion Arts Centre on Sundays and the Salisbury Fringe hub on Saturday, February 22.
