SOUTH Australian agribusiness Elders has posted a 71 per cent jump in underlying profit after tax to $109m, showcasing its resilience in the face of drought, bushfires and the challenges brought on by COVID-19.
In the 12 months to the end of September, Elders, which employs more than 2000 staff, reported a statutory profit after tax of $122.9m. Underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at $119.4m, representing an increase of 62 per cent on FY19.
The business also announced a fully franked final dividend of 13c a share. Chief executive and managing director Mark Allison, who took home $3.2m (including incentives) in remuneration, said the strong results were “particularly pleasing” given they were achieved despite the ongoing challenges and without any government assistance in the form of JobKeeper or other COVID-19 support measures.
“Our FY20 results highlight the resilience of our business, the benefits of our diversification across both geographies and products, and our acquisition strategy,” Mr Allison said.
“Our solid business foundations and strict financial discipline, together with a comm­itment to ensuring the safety and prosperity of clients, communities and staff across Australia, allowed us to succeed despite challenging operating conditions in FY20.” The performance of Elders’ rural products division was a highlight following the acquisition and integration of supplies wholesaler AIRR, which added $44.0m in wholesale gross margin, well in excess of acquisition projections.
Chairman Ian Wilton said it was Elders’ strongest result in a decade. “The sector has withstood remarkable obstacles in a year full of volatility …,” he said. “Yet, throughout, agriculture has emerged more resilient and continued to perform strongly. As has Elders.”
