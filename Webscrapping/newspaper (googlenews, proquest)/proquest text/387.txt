BASKETBALL ON THE back of an impressive run, the Castec Rural Pioneers welcomed back Tom Daly and took to the road in search of another win on Friday evening.
The Pioneers visited the Belconnen Basketball Stadium in the nationâ€™s capital to take on the young guns from the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence but struggled to keep up with the BA CoE in the first quarter trailing by 10 points at the first break.
The second term saw the Pioneers fight hard and slowly close the gap to three points with a little over three minutes to go before the main break, before creeping out to seven points with 90 seconds to go and then closing to five points at the break.
The 23-point quarter saw Tom Daly lead the scoring for the Pioneers with 13 points for the half, one point in front of Alex Marzette on 12.
Defensively the Pioneers were struggling to hold Kyle Bowen who racked up 20 points and nine rebounds in the first half.
The third term ended with the gap still at five points and the Pioneers in the hunt with Marzette up to 20 points and Bowen held to just two points for the quarter.
The final term was an epic affair with the Pioneers wrestling back the lead to be in front by two points with 17 seconds remaining only to be level with five seconds on the clock.
With three seconds remaining Erik Burdon found Luke Jamieson who made the jump shot to record a stunning come-from-behind victory that keeps the dream alive.
Marzette finished with 22 points and eight rebounds; Daly recorded 19 points in his return game; and Burdon also finished with 19 points and five assists in what could prove to be a monumental result come the end of the season.
