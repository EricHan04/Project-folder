ADELAIDE medical device developer Signostics is on a hiring push as it moves towards the global launch of its portable, high resolution ultrasound system.
The company was last week the first to move into the $12.9 million BioSA incubator at Thebarton.
The incubator was designed to provide laboratory and office accommodation suites for early-stage biotech companies, as well as access to shared equipment and storage.
Signostics is currently going through the approvals process in Australia, Europe and the U.S. for its "Speq" ultrasound device.
Speq is an ultrasound small enough to be carried in a doctor's pocket, meaning diagnoses can be made rapidly, improving patient care and saving time and money.
Signostics co-founder Stewart Bartlett said the company had about 30 full-time employees, with 26 in Australia and four at the company's U.S. office, which it established in February.
While it was yet to launch its first product, pending approvals, it was already starting work on a next-generation offering.
"We anticipate shipping our product in the fourth quarter this year," Mr Bartlett said.
"We're recruiting more technical people to work on improvements to the product."
Mr Bartlett said the global market for the Speq was estimated to be about $US2.9 billion. The response from the company's first trade show outing recently, at the Australian Veterinary Association Annual Conference, was strong.
"We are doing some test marketing in the veterinary market," Mr Bartlett said. "At the vet show our guys were run off their feet."
Mr Bartlett said the company hoped to hear back about the progress of its approval in the U.S. in the next two to three weeks.
Work began on the Speq device in 2001. Signostics founders Stewart Bartlett, Neil Bartlett and Glenn Costa based the firm at Thebarton after receiving an early stage $250,000 AusIndustry grant from the Federal Government and $125,000 in proof-of-concept funding from Bio Innovation SA.
