As THE founder of SA’s globally renowned couture house Paolo Sebastian, Paul Vasileff has one key take-home message for start-ups.
And that is to always listen to your inner voice rather than anyone who says your business idea will not work.
The 28-year-old was last week a guest speaker at the SouthStart start-up conference.
Now recognised as one of SA’s greatest fashion success stories, Vasileff was just 16 when he staged a CanTeen fundraiser to launch Paolo Sebastian 11 years ago.
Paolo Sebastian, which now employs 18 staff, has well and truly gone global. “So many people said it wouldn’t be possible for me,” Vasileff (picutred) said of his dream to build a couture house in his hometown.“I was doing something new and different and there was nothing to go by in the state or the country. I took a leap of faith and had no option but to make it work.”
