SA PATHOLOGY has “paused” the use of an SMS service sending COVID test results after one was sent to the wrong person. Health Minister Stephen Wade said the error may have been due to a transcription error in the name or phone number.
SA Pathology said yesterday said: “Personify Care remains engaged to deliver our digital service, however we’ve paused the use of their SMS delivery function while we review the best way to communicate increased number of COVID-19 test results.” Personify Care’s Ken Saman said there had been no data or privacy breaches and “we will continue to work with SA Pathology.”
