Kirin, the second-largest brewer in Japan, said yesterday it would buy National Foods from San Miguel, the Philippine food and beverage conglomerate, by year's end."By adding National Foods' strong brands to its product portfolio, Kirin is laying strong business foundations in the field of the `food and health' business in Asia and Oceania," Kirin said.
Lion Nathan, in which Kirin bought a 46 per cent stake in 1998, announced yesterday that it was buying Tasmanian premium brewer J Boag & Son for $325 million from San Miguel, which in turn bought it in 2000 for $92 million.
