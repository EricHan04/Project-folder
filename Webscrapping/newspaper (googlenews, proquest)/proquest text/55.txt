IN the the biggest shock of the Baseball SA season, Adelaide Angels thrashed the previously undefeated Goodwood Indians 12-2 on the weekend.
With Alex Ditrich on top of the mound and Jan Jablonka belting a home run and batting four runs in, the Angels proved the previous week's win over Sturt was not a fluke. Woodville pulled off a miracle win against East Torrens, scoring five runs in the final inning to win 11-8.
A well pitched game saw Southern Districts mark itself a serious premiership threat with a 3-2 victory over Kensington.
Sturt beat Northern Districts 6-1, West Torrens downed Henley & Grange 6-0 and Port Adelaide beat Golden Grove Central District 7-4.
