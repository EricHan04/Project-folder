STOP the Perth Wildcats. That's the four-word formula for winning the 2013-14 NBL championship which tips off tonight in Auckland.
While reigning champion New Zealand will start strong favourite to beat a Wollongong travelling with just one import, it will be Adelaide 36ers tomorrow at Perth Arena having the first crack at denting the Wildcats' unwavering confidence that this season will yield them NBL crown number six.
The championship would sit comfortably alongside the club's record six pre-season titles to which it added number seven with the inaugural Loggins-Bruton Cup.
Pre-season means precious little - we all know that. But it did show that new Wildcats import James Ennis - drafted into the NBA this year and given the opportunity by Miami Heat to spend a season overseas - will start as favourite for the MVP.
And that Perth, in its 12,000-plus-capacity home fortress, is the club to catch, yet again.
That hasn't changed but so much has with the appointment overnight of a new NBL chief executive in Fraser Neill, the league breaking away from Basketball Australia and the clubs uniting to insist the competition makes entertainment its primary focus.
In line with that, the best crop of new import faces since the turn of the century has flocked into the NBL, along with returning Aussies from Europe such as Mark Worthington, Steve Markovic and AJ Ogilvy.
Ennis and Jermaine Beal at Perth, Gary Ervin and Jarrid Frye at Adelaide, Scott Morrison, Ayinde Ubaka (Melbourne), Jesse Sanders, Charles Carmouche (Sydney), Kerron Johnson, Darnell Lazare (NZ), Rotnei Clarke (Wollongong), Demetri McCamey, Jamar Wilson (Cairns) and Josh Pace, Brian Conklin (Townsville) will help bring back the excitement the NBL once generated.
Cairns has recruited Rookie of the Year favourite Mitch Young while Taipans swingman Cam Glid-don most likely will battle Tigers forward Lucas Walker for the league's Most Improved honours.
The Kings celebrate their 25th season while the Crocodiles celebrate surviving extinction. With the game on TV at Ten and ONE, tip-off cannot come soon enough.

ADELAIDE 36ERS WITHOUT doubt the 36ers will be fun to watch again and the big improvers.
Whether they can get all the way back to the playoffs is debatable, Schensch (back) doubtful to be able to reach full impact and the season starting with an injury cloud over Gibbo.
Last Year: 8-20, 8th Coach: Joey Wright (166-120, 58%) Returning: Jason Cadee, Mitch Creek, Adam Gibson, Daniel Johnson, Anthony Petrie, Luke Schenscher.
New: BJ Anthony (NZ NBL), *Gary Ervin (Townsville Crocodiles), *Jarrid Frye (Stjarnan, Iceland), Brendan Teys (Brisbane Spartans).
Gone: *Scott Christopherson (Obscurity), Stevie Weigh (Cairns) Nathan Crosswell (ret), CJ Massingale (Knox Raiders, SEABL), Pero Vasiljevic (North Rockets, SA SBL).
X-Factor: Last time Adelaide picked up a league MVP it went straight to the grand final.
Gary Ervin will need to emulate Rob Rose for that to happen again.
TAB Title Odds: $5 Our Tip: 5th CAIRNS TAIPANS Last Year: 11-17, 6th Coach: Aaron Fearne (56-62, 47%) Returning: Shaun Bruce, Cameron Gliddon, Alex Loughton, Clint Steindl, Cameron Tragardh, *Jamar Wilson.
New: Matt Burston (Melbourne Tigers), *Demetri McCamey (Fort Wayne, D-League), Stephen Weigh (Adelaide 36ers), Mitch Young (St Mary's College).
Gone: *Shane Edwards (Pumping gas), Aaron Grabau (ret), Brad Hill (Sydney Kings), Dusty Rychart (ret), Kerry Williams (ret) X-Factor: Cam Tragardh is the man in whose hands you want the ball at the end of a shot-clock but his namesake Cam Gliddon will be this year's emerging star.
TAB Title Odds: $9 Our Tip: 4th
MELBOURNE TIGERS Last Year: 12-16, 5th Coach: Chris Anstey (12-16, 43%) Returning: Adam Ballinger, Chris Goulding, Tommy Greer, Nate Tomlinson, Lucas Walker.
New: Auryn Macmillan (Wollongong Hawks), *Scott Morrison (Bremerhaven, Germany), Greg Page (DP), Owen Odigie (DP), *Ayinde Ubaka (Hoverla, Ukraine), Mark Worthington (Radnicki, Serbia).
Gone: *Kevin Braswell (Southland Sharks, NZ), Matt Burston (Cairns Taipans), *Stephen Dennis (Preseason inj), *Jonny Flynn (Sichuan, China), Bennie Lewis (MIA), Liam Rush (Uppsala, Sweden), *Seth Scott (Humacao, Puerto Rico).
X-Factor: Mark Worthington's return to the NBL is a huge boost for the Tigers but watch Lucas Walker step into the spotlight this season too.
TAB Title Odds: $8.50 Our Tip: 2nd 2013-14 NEW ZEALAND BREAKERS Last Year: 24-4, 1st, Won Championship Coach: Dean Vickerman (R) Returning: Tom Abercrombie, CJ Bruton, Daryl Corletto, Alex Pledger, Mika Vukona, Corey Webster.
New: *Kerron Johnson (Belmont University), *Darnell Lazare (Sydney Kings), Reuben Te Rangi (Southland Sharks, NZ), Jeremiah Trueman (Perth Wildcats).
Gone: Dillon Boucher (ret), Leon Henry (Southland Sharks, NZ), *Will Hudson (Byda Fone, US), *Cedric Jackson (Union Olimpija, Slovenia) X-Factor: The pressure of an unprecedented fourth straight title run and wearing a bullseye for every Australian team will make this a flamegrilled baptism for Dean Vickerman.
TAB Title Odds: $4.75 Our Tip: 3rd PERTH WILDCATS Last Year: 22-6, 2nd, Lost Grand Final Coach: Trevor Gleeson (103-88, 54%) Returning: Greg Hire, Matt Knight, Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage, Jesse Wagstaff.
New: *Jermaine Beal (Minas, Brazil), Erik Burdon (Mt Gambier Pioneers, SEABL), U'u Drake (California Polytechnic State U), *James Ennis (Long Beach State U), Tom Jervis (East Perth Eagles, WA SBL), Jarrad Prue (Lakeside Lightning, WA SBL).
Gone: Everard Bartlett (Gorn, Fishen), *Kevin Lisch (JSF Nanterre, Italy), Brad Robbins (ret), Cam Tovey (ret), Jeremiah Trueman (NZ Breakers).
X-Factor: The only potential derailment for the Wildcats would be if Miami Heat called up Ennis in-season, though even then, the support cast would still see playoff action.
TAB Title Odds: $3.25 Our Tip: 1st SYDNEY KINGS Last Year: 12-16, 4th, lost in semi finals Coach: Shane Heal (34-56, 38%) Returning: Tom Garlepp, James Harvey, Ben Madgen, Kevin White. New: Ben Allen (Townsville), Kyle Armour (Willetton, WA SBL), *Charles Carmouche (Louisiana State U), Cody Ellis (St Louis U), Shaun Gleeson (Gladstone, QBL), Brad Hill (Cairns), AJ Ogilvy (Brose Baskets, Germany), *Jesse Sanders (Fileni BPA Jesi, Italy).
Gone: Aaron Bruce (Home and Away), Ian Crosswhite (ret), Graeme Dann (ret), *Corin Henry (BC Rilski, Bulgaria), *Darnell Lazare (NZ Breakers), Luke Martin (Southland, NZNBL) X-Factor: Ogilvy could be the NBL's best big man. He is good facing the basket, great with his back to it and will keep the Kings in contention.
TAB Title Odds: $9 Our Tip: 6th TOWNSVILLE CROCODILES Last Year: 10-18, 7th Coach: Shawn Dennis (30- 56, 35%) Returning: Todd Blanchfield, Peter Crawford, Russell Hinder, Jacob Holmes, Mitch Norton.
New: *Brian Conklin (Southland Sharks, NZNBL), Mirko Djeric (Wollongong Hawks), Steve Markovic (Radnicki, Serbia), *Josh Pace (Nelson Giants, NZNBL), Kenny Scott (Brisbane Spartans, SEABL), Greg Vanderjagt (Wilderness, Qld).
Gone: *Larry Abney (ret), Ben Allen (Sydney Kings), Michael Cedar (Izat Myagent), Chris Cedar (No-Itz Mein), *Gary Ervin (Adelaide 36ers), Luke Nevill (Job Seeker).
X-Factor: The impact London Olympian Peter Crawford has when he makes it back from injury will be huge in determining Townsville's final fate.
TAB Title Odds: $20 Our Tip: 8th WOLLONGONG HAWKS Last Year: 13-15, 3rd, lost in semi finals Coach: Gordon McLeod (171-209, 45%) Returning: Tim Coenraad, Larry Davidson, Tyson Demos, Oscar Forman, Dave Gruber, Rhys Martin.
New: *Rotnei Clarke (Butler University), Dominique Cooks (Chaminade University), Shane Harris-Tunks (University of Colorado), Luke Jamieson (DP).
Gone: *Adris Deleon (Vaqueros de Bayamon, Spain), *Lance Hurdle (Byda Fax), Daniel Jackson (SG1-Off-world), Auryn Macmillan (Melbourne Tigers), Glen Saville (ret), *Durrell Summers (Chay Sing, Euros).
X-Factor: Clarke can shoot the ball but the unknown import becomes the key here as McLeod teams always are well-drilled and able to beat you down on fundamentals.
