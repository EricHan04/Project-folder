TEMPLE Christian College's remote-controlled boat Faster Than You has lived up to its name, beating entries from across the country in an engineering competition.
The Concept2Creation competition was run by the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group - an alliance of local manufacturing businesses - and required students to create electronic innovations such as boats and drones.
Temple Christian College entered two Year 10 classes, comprising 28 students, and were up against 28 other schools from across the country.
One class built Faster Than You, a 121cm long boat which collects water samples from local wetlands.
It took out first place in the Suburban Wetlands Acquisition and Telemetry System (SWAT) Challenge for the third consecutive year.
The other class built a remote-controlled drone capable of detecting faulty power cables and insulators - it awarded first place in the SA Power Networks Drone Challenge.
Technology and Design teacher Kevin Bothma said the challenge was launched after industry expertsrealised there was an obvious gap between theory and practical knowledge among university graduates.
"The work these students have done really is ingenious, especially at their age," Mr Bothma said.
Caleb, 16, helped make the boat and said team work played a major role in the outcome.
"We encountered a few problems, like the motor stopped working and the batteries kept short-circuiting, but it was good to get through it together," Caleb said.
Zac, also 16, said he had Mr Bothma and the other students to thank for the project's success.The school received a certificate and an engraving on the challenge's shield.
