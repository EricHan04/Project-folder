CRICKET
RICKY Ponting has warned the world's fastest bowler Shoaib Akhtar that Australia has no fear of his bowling or his motor mouth in cricket's showdown of the summer.
Australia yesterday completed its 2-0 destruction of New Zealand in the trans-Tasman series, leaving Ponting and the nation's cricket fans hankering for a spicy confrontation between the Pakistani thunderbolt and Australia's domineering batsmen on the game's fastest pitch in Perth.
Ponting yesterday said his men were craving the competition and were unfazed by the verbal taunts sure to flow their way.
"I think he (Akhtar) tries to get under your skin a bit, as he did in the last tour of Australia," Ponting said.
"The good thing about it is we have had some success against him, so we don't need to build it up too much or say too much back to him.
"He can do whatever he wants to put us off. It's a bit of a challenge to us to be as strong as we possibly can and make sure we are doing the job with the bat.
"So I am sure all those antics will continue in this next series and I am sure we will enjoy it as well."
Akhtar was unconcerned by Ponting's remarks when told about them at the team hotel in Perth yesterday.
"Let them talk but I want to talk with the ball rather than talk myself," he said.
"I'm fit and strong, I am paid to bowl quick and I have a few more years to bowl quick.
"They are the toughest batsmen in the world and it is not going to be easy for us."
The clash with Pakistan starting on December 16 will boost an international summer punctured by a boring and out-of-its-depth Black Caps unit, which lost the second Test in Adelaide by 213 runs yesterday.
Chasing 464 to win, New Zealand added just one run to its overnight total of 5-149 before Jacob Oram (40) edged Glenn McGrath to Adam Gilchrist, a mortal blow to any hope the Black Caps had of saving the game.
Skipper Stephen Fleming would have been glued to online weather forecasts when Jason Gillespie softened up keeper Brendon McCullum then trapped him lbw with the score on 160.
Daniel Vettori applied himself as those higher up the order should have in making 59 but this just delayed the inevitable, with the Kiwis eventually dismissed for 250, one run less than their first innings total.
The Australian attack of McGrath (2-32), Gillespie (2-41), Michael Kasprowicz (2-39), and spinners Shane Warne (2-79) and Darren Lehmann (2-46) shared the spoils in a relentless assault on the Kiwis.
Ponting praised the work of his attack on curator Les Burdett's superb Adelaide Oval strip.
"This group of bowlers is something very special, there's no doubt about that," Ponting said.
"The way we were able to build and maintain pressure on a very good batting wicket was something very special in itself."
The form of McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz is likely to keep speedster Brett Lee out of the Aussie line-up in Perth.
However, Ponting believes the embarrassment of riches augurs well for the future of the side, which will eventually adopt a rotation policy for its bowlers.
"It's a great sign for Australian cricket that we have someone like him (Lee) who is not in our team," said Ponting of the NSW tearaway.
"You always measure the quality of a side by the guys that aren't playing. I am sure Brett would walk into most other teams anywhere in the world."
Explaining the fourth day go-slow which saw Australia bat at snail's pace in the morning session and then add four runs in four overs after lunch, Ponting said: "We wanted to keep them in the field pretty much as long as we could and play them out of the game.
"One thing we did want to do was make sure they had no momentum whatsoever going into their batting innings.
"So I think we planned this game really well."
