WARREN Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said yesterday that it would be adding the Greensboro, North Carolina, News & Record to its growing newspaper division.
Berkshire bought the 122year-old daily newspaper from Landmark Media Enterprises.
Financial terms were not disclosed. The Omaha World-Herald, which oversees Berkshire's newspaper division, reported that the News & Record has daily circulation of 58,000 and Sunday circulation of 86,000.
Buffett did not immediately respond yesterday to email questions about the Greensboro acquisition.
However, Omaha World-Herald publisher Terry Kroeger said the newspaper would be a great fit with the other small and medium-sized community newspapers Berkshire has purchased.
"We're delighted to have the Greensboro News & Record join our growing family of newspapers," Kroeger said.
Newspapers are a small part of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns more than 80 subsidiaries and holds major stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM.
Buffett has said he thinks newspapers will continue earning a decent return as long as they remain the primary source of information about their communities.
Outsell Inc media analyst Ken Doctor said Buffett was becoming the buyer of choice for these smaller newspapers.
"Warren Buffett is emerging as the main-street buyer of newspapers," Doctor said.
Last year Berkshire acquired 63 Media General titles for $142 million and launched its new newspaper unit. The Media General papers joined the Buffalo News, the Omaha World-Herald and several other titles in Nebraska and Iowa Berkshire already owned.
