A Robe start up business has been accepted into Flinders University's eNVIsion Venture Dorm.
Almost two years has passed since Geoffrey Dening's Robe SA app was developed and published. Thanks to the support of local businesses it has now grown to include Great Ocean Road, Kangaroo Island, Barossa Valley and Limestone Coast apps all published to iTunes and Google stores.
With over 3500 subscribers downloading the apps, users are increasing daily. Goingtoplaces.com is now registered with the SA Tourism Commission Media Gallery to use the best images and media for promoting South Australia.
In July 2017, founder Mr Dening participated in SouthStart Conference and Expo at the Adelaide Convention Centre. A very positive two days of presentations, meeting other innovators in the industry, was a beneficial experience.
Information received in August from David Furness of the LC Regional Development Association, on the plan to establish a contemporary workspace in Mount Gambier by Flinders University's, New Venture Institute was particularly encouraging.
Geoffrey attended the public launch on December 7 in Mount Gambier and met with the management of the program.
Goingtoplaces.com was one of the earliest accepted into their first 20 startups for the Incubator. The eNVIsion Incubator is a collaborative, co-working space.
Working at eNVIsion connects businesses to a global network and a wealth of expertise that can help them achieve goals.
