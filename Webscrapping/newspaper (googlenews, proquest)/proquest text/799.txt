IT took a long time before Andre’s career finally hit paydirt. On the way, he got half an accounting degree, had a failed family business, did some acting, was the lead singer of a cover band, ran a failed theatre production company and then a one-man video production company that was meant to be a film company but never quite got there, set up an online site for social wine lovers which made no money, and then went on a year-long wine adventure travelling around Australia in a Kombi. And then he and partner Justin Dry launched wine company Vinomofo, developing it from a garage business to a $100 million wine brand.
Andre recently stepped down as CEO to create transformation agency Cult Tribal, to help companies build culture-led brands. A thought sharer and passionate speaker, he will be one of the speakers at the SouthStart start-up conference from November 22-23.■ Details: southstart.co
