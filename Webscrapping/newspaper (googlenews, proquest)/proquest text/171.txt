FAVOURABLE sentiment towards Australia's regional financial institutions has resulted in the recent shift to a positive outlook for the Bank of Queensland and upgrades to Adelaide Bank and the Bank of Western Australia, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said yesterday.
The ratings agency yesterday released its quarterly review of rated regional financial institutions which said favourable operating conditions, combined with careful and well-executed strategies, strengthened the business foundations of the sector.
S&P credit analyst Craig Bennett said the financial profiles of the regionals, which included smaller rated regional banks and the non-bank financial institutions, showed increased resilience to a possible deterioration in economic/j conditions.
Continued enhancement in financial profiles, combined with reductions in business risks, underpinned the sector's recent favourable ratings sentiment, S&P said. They benefited from 13 years of unbroken economic growth.
