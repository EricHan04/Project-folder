PAKISTAN opener Salman Butt yesterday pushed his case for selection in next week's first Test with a classy century against the Cricket Australia Chairman's XI in Perth.
Salman struck an unbeaten 115 off 135 balls as Pakistan reached a competitive 9/256 in the 50-over clash at Lilac Hill.
In reply, the Chairman's XI advanced to 1/50 from 11 overs, with Chris Rogers unbeaten on 18 and Mike Hussey on one. Test opener Justin Langer failed, making just one run before falling to a regulation snick to second slip off the bowling of Mohammad Khalil.
Pakistan entered the match without speedsters Mohammad Sami and Shoaib Akhtar but included captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, who missed the tour-opener against Western Australia's second XI with bronchitis. Despite the perfect batting conditions and the ground's post-stamp dimensions, most of Pakistan's batsmen struggled against the modest Chairman's XI attack.
The exception was Salman, who is jostling with Yasir Hameed for the second opening slot in Pakistan's Test line-up.
He played shots on both sides of the wicket and laced his innings with 11 fours and a six.
The next top scorer was co-opener Imran Farhat, who made 25 from 29 balls, while Abdul Razzaq struck a patient 24 (44 balls).
Despite ending his international career more than a decade ago, Tony Dodemaide was arguably the pick of the bowlers with 1/25 off five overs. Fellow 1980s-era paceman Geoff Lawson collected 1/31 from six overs and Mike Hussey took 3/28.
