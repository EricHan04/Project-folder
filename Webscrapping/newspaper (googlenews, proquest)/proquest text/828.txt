GREG Kelton's remarks on Mitch Williams industrial relations portfolio (The Advertiser, 23/12/06) fails to take into account that it is the Howard Government's industrial relations changes that have created tens of thousands of new jobs and given employers confidence to hire as needed.
These new employees are getting far more spendable money than unemployment benefits gave them. They can hold their heads high, knowing they earn their money, work and pay tax.
Employers may not always be able to offer long-term, full-time jobs, but thousands of long-term unemployed are now employed in SA (and Australia), and not because of Mike Rann or his government.
