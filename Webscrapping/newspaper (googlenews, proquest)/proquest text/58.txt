THE Adelaide Angels defeated last season's minor premier Port Adelaide in a nailbiting affair 8-6 to send the message around the league they are not just in it to fill in the numbers.
Port has returned to form in recent weeks and it seemed this would continue as the Magpies raced to a 4-0 lead by the third inning thanks to a home run by Josh Cakebread.
But a defensive blunder from the Magpies allowed the Angels the extra out they needed as they rebounded with five runs of their own, three of which came from a massive homer by coach Darren White.
Nick Trainor showed some good signs in his first game for his new club after moving over from Woodville in the off-season.
Justin Rowe again collected multiple hits and four runs batted in to continue his great start to the year.
Pitching was the story of the day for the Angels as their Canadian import Adam Hawes went seven innings striking out 11 before handing the ball to Justin Ellery who struck out the side twice to secure a nail biter with Port having the winning run at the plate in the form of Josh Cakebread who had two home runs for the day.
