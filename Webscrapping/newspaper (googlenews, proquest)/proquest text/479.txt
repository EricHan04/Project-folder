THE promise of a quick and bouncy WACA wicket has strengthened calls for Brett Lee to play in the first Test against Pakistan starting next Thursday.
WACA curator Richard Winter said early indications were the Test pitch would play to its reputation as a fast bowler's paradise.
It will be the same deck used in a one-day match on February 1 this year, when Lee's deliveries repeatedly carried through to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist at head height.
A spell of mid-high 30C maximums in Perth this week is expected to further harden the pitch and add to the menacing bounce.
"It's certainly all there for it to happen," Winter said.
"At this stage the preparation is looking very good. It's got a nice, beautiful, grass cover on it. It's very flat. It depends a lot on the weather . . . but it would be nice to see a quick, bouncy wicket and I can't see why we wouldn't."
Pakistan's pace enforcer Shoaib Akhtar will sample the WACA's conditions in the tour match against Western Australia starting today. The tourists will unveil a Test-strength line-up for the four- day clash clash.
Selectors have given Shoaib Malik until this morning to prove his fitness after the allrounder injured his bowling hand while playing table soccer on Sunday night. Left arm-speedster Mohammad Khalil has been placed on standby for Malik.
The Pakistanis were yesterday put through what appeared a torturous two-hour training session in the blazing 36C heat at the WACA.
But Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said: "They're used to training in Lahore where it gets up to 46C. It was nothing for these guys."
