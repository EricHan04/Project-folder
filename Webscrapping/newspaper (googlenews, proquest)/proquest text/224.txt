IMPENDING skills shortages have inspired industries to build better relationships with schools and create new opportunities for students contemplating future career paths.
As part of the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group's Concept2Creation program, schools compete in an Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Challenge.
This year organisers have paired schools with squadrons at the Royal Australian Air Force.
Squadrons4Schools aims to provide extra support and guidance for the challenge in October. Flight Lieutenant Oliver Glendon said the students were "pretty keen" and the skills they acquired in the course of the challenge would be "applicable across a range of industries and professions".
If they developed a particular interest in UAVs, there would be "plenty of avenues for them" to pursue, both "civilian and military".
"The applications for UAV are just growing and growing," he said.
"It's a cost-effective solution for a lot of tasks we currently do, inspections of powerlines for example in far outlying places, or surveying land, which is typically done by manned means at the moment."
