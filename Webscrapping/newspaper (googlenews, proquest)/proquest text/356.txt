SOUTH Australia has been well represented at a global tech festival held in the UK.
High tech start-up accelerator TechInSA awarded four travel grants of $6000 each to allow local start-ups to attend London Tech Week.
TechInSA chief executive Joe Thorp said the chance to network with industry from around the world was invaluable.
“South Australia already has a strong support network for entrepreneurs and start-ups but it’s also important to learn from the successes achieved in other markets to plan for further growth, which is why we provide funding for events like LTW,” he said.
“The value of actually visiting new markets, meeting key leaders and exploring potential partnerships and possibilities cannot be underestimated when you’re an entrepreneur striving to scale a business.” It’s a sentiment appreciated by Denis Stollery, inventor and founder of Adelaide’s fin-tech start-up bzPay, which offers new payment options for banks and financiers.
“For me, the trip to LTW was incredibly valuable,” he said.
“I’ve gained fantastic insight into the payment space in the UK and what role bzPay can play with banks adopting and promoting our platform to their customers.’’Adelaide’s TCPinpoint, A Backbone Computing Solution and Link4 also received grants to attend the event.
