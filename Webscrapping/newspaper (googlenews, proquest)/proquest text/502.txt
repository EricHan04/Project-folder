BRAZIL could be without striker Fred for Saturday's international friendly against Australia in Brasilia with a thigh strain.
The 29-year-old suffered the injury during Fluminense's 2-0 loss to Santos in the Brazilian Championship on Saturday night.
Fred is also in danger of missing Brazil's clash against Portugal in Boston on September 10.
"I felt something while taking a shot," the former Lyon forward said. "When that happens it's always bad news." "I'm worried about the rest of the season." Fred is expected to be assessed by Brazil's medical staff on Monday. His absence could provide a rare international start for Atletico Mineiro's former Manchester City striker Jo.
