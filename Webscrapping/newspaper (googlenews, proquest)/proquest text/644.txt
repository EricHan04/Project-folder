THE pressure on herbicides, in terms of the threat of weed resistance, is going to continue to grow and the cropping sector needs to continue to push for alternative modes of control.
That was the message from a University of Sydney researcher addressing the Vic Farmers Federation grains conference earlier this year.
"Trying to alleviate the impact of resistance means we desperately need alternative technologies, not just new herbicides," said Mike Walsh, a specialist weed researcher based at the university's Narrabri, NSW, campus.
Dr Walsh said there was a lot of work being done on weed identification using sensor technology and emerging concepts, such as the Swarm Farm, where a number of small drones are sent out to the paddock to target spray weeds or the Bilberry system, which recognises individual weed species.
"It is coming along, but it is not easy or quick," he said.
Dr Walsh said there were also other concepts, such as laser or microwave weeding which had been demonstrated as concepts, but needed further work before they could be used economically on a commercial scale.
In the shorter term, he said harvest weed seed control options, such as the Harrington Seed Destructor and the Seed Terminator, continued to prove popular.
He said there had been strong interest in the milling system, which was spurred by weaknesses in other systems, such as the grazing of chaff lines leading to greater ryegrass germination.
With so many options available in the space, he said he would like to see independent testing, especially in machines utilising a milling system to crush weed seeds.
For in-crop control, he said there were two key areas for researchers to focus on.
"Both are in the period after crop emergence - we need to look at the early post-emergence when the new crop is competing against weed species in order to get established and then slightly later on at the late post-emergence period," Dr Walsh said.
