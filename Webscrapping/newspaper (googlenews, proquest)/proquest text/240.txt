A COMMON plastic used to make everything from water bottles to plastic bags could be used to protect combat vehicles from deadly bomb attacks.
World-leading breakthrough research in Australia has discovered that polyethelene - the world's most produced plastic polymer - has the potential to increase resistance of armoured vehicles to roadside bombs and rocket attacks.
Dr Long Nguyen from Australia's Defence Science Technology Group was awarded the 2016 Land Defence Australia Young Innovator Scholarship in Adelaide yesterday for his work in developing a mathematical model that predicts how the polyethelene composite armour performs under ballistic impacts and a computer model that can simulate behaviour of the armour under high impact.
Dr Nguyen said that the toughened plastic composite armour could also reduce the weight of heavy land-based vehicles by up to a third, improving fuel efficiency and speed of the vehicles.
"If you look at the Bushmaster, it weighs about 15 tonnes - and the Hawkei weighs about 10 tonnes - and a lot of that weight is contributed to armour," he said of land-based vehicles in service and about to enter service for the Australian Army.
"The other issue with metals is if you get a puncture or perforation you get a lot of shrapnel that comes behind it. (Polyethelene) holds its shape quite well." Dr Nguyen was among 16 defence industry innovators named as finalists in the industry innovation awards, presented at the 2016 Land Forces event in Adelaide South Australian Sarah Hibbard, of Consilium Technology, received a high commendation in the Young Innovator category for her research in exploring the value of virtual reality technology and the associated phenomenon of cyber sickness experienced by some users of VR headsets and displays. Meanwhile, Melbourne apparel company Australian Defence Apparel won the national innovation award for developing an adjustable backpack frame, which is being supplied to the Australian Army.Sydney company Marathon Targets received the small and medium enterprise innovation grant for its autonomous robotic small-arms target system, which enables soldiers to shoot life-sized moving mannequins attached to robotic platforms.
