BLACKLIGHT golf - an indoor course played in a dark room with fluoro surrounds - is among the attractions planned for a new family entertainment centre.
Goldendale Developments has applied to Salisbury Council to build a 2600sq m entertainment centre at 901 Port Wakefield Rd, Bolivar.
It is estimated to cost about $2 million.
The plans are available for public comment until Friday and also feature outdoor go karts, a laser skirmish arena, minigolf and arcade machines.
The development would span 27,600sq m, with the kart tracks occupying most of the land.
It will also feature a reception area, kiosk, a conference room, a briefing room, mechanics shed, small store and a large carpark.
Goldendale Developments director Ross Edwards said a foam ball shooting skill game and a 'TimeFreak' game, which requires players to frantically push buttons as they light up around a dark room lit with UV lights, would also be included.
"I think it would be great for the area, especially for kids," Mr Edwards said. The site would also host birthday parties and other social events. He hoped the development could begin by the end of the year, subject to approval, and anticipated the centre could be open within 12 months after that.
Mayor Gillian Aldridge hoped the development would be a great attraction for the north.The application is expected to go to the Development Assessment Panel in the coming weeks.
