FORMER Dutch national pitcher Tom Stuifbergen threw a no-hitter for the Adelaide Angels in their 1-0 win over Woodville in Baseball SA's top division on Sunday.
Stuifbergen, who signed as a non-drafted free agent with the Minnesota Twins in 2006, played as a rookie with the Gulf Coast Twins in the tough Gulf Coast League in 2007.
He was assigned to the Twins' 60-day disabled list and is yet to pitch in the U.S. this year.
Stuifbergen collected 13 strike-outs in a dominant performance for the Angels, throwing less than 100 pitches and only five off-speed as he relied on his fastball.
A run-scoring double from Justin Roe in the first inning was the only score in the contest.
It took 13 innings to separate Port Adelaide and Goodwood after three Magpies runs tied the game in the bottom of the ninth.
The game was level 1-1 through seven innings before the Indians scored three runs in the eighth frame, which was matched by Port in the regulation final dig. Stephan Welch batted the winning run in for Goodwood in the 13th.
A home run from Jake Haaker in the sixth gave East Torrens a 1-0 win over Southern Districts.
Michael Forbes belted two home runs and batted in seven runs in West Torrens' 12-2 victory over Golden Grove Central Districts.
Glenelg hammered Kensington 13-4 while Sturt defeated Northern Districts 9-6.
