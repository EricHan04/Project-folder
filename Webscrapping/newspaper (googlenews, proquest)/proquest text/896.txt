THE former Mitsubishi car plant site at Tonsley Park now has its first tenant.
It is the prototype for a planned $100 million "green" data centre that its owners describe as being the "engine room of the internet".
Adelaide firm Tier 5 teamed with global IT company Dell to assemble Dell's latest modular data centre, the first in the world to go live, providing data storage and processing at half the energy use of traditional data centres.
It plans to take up 4500sq m, or about 3 per cent, of the former car assembly shed.
Dell Australia and New Zealand managing director Joe Kremer said the $53 billion company had worked with Tier 5 for two years to design the Adelaide centre expected to save $8 million in power costs each year, using gas-fired electricity generators and natural air flow to keep racks of servers cool.
Waste heat from the data centre's cogeneration plant also could be used to benefit other future tenants of the site, including the State Government's new $125 million "green" trade training hub announced for the site in September.
"Australia is one of our top 10 global destinations and Tier 5 is the right partner to launch with," Mr Kremer said about Dell's data centre ambitions and its relationships with the eight-employee Adelaide company.
Tier 5 founder Marty Gauvin said the planned 8 megawatt data centre would be Australia's 10th largest, with initial customers expected to be mainly resellers of capacity and companies needing to do their own IT processing.
Tier 5's data centre model would be "regionally competitive" but could also prove a competitor to Sydney-based data centres, which house IT processing for Australia's biggest corporations.
Mr Gauvin expected the centre to gain Tier 3 accreditation, giving it reliability for mission-critical systems such as those required by banks.
