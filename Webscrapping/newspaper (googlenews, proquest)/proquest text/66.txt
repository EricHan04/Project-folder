SOUTH Australia is sending a well-balanced baseball side for the 2003 Claxton Shield championship in Blacktown, NSW, in an effort to break its longest drought in the competition since the trophy was first presented in 1934.
SA hits off today with a 7pm game against NSW, followed by matches each day against Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria, then an Australian Provincial side for a place in Friday's semi- finals.
The Grand Final will be played next Saturday at 7pm.
SA has named 10 players that can pitch, including Adelaide Angels coach Darren White, who is better known as an aggressive and powerful batter.
