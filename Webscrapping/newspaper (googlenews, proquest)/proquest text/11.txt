THE Adelaide Angels defeated last season minor premier Port Adelaide in a nail biting affair 8-6. The Magpies had raced to a 4-0 lead by the third inning thanks to a home run by Josh Cakebread.
But a defensive blunder from Port allowed the Angels the extra out they needed as they rebounded with five runs of their own, three of which came from a massive homer by coach Darren White.
Glenelg showed some offensive form with a 10-0 mercy rule victory over an in-form Kensington outfit.
