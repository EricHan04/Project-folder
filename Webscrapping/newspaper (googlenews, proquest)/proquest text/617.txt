FAILED venture capital firm Blue Sky will be replaced as manager of the state’s $50 million venture capital fund but its Adelaide-based staff will continue managing it, the State Government says.
The future management of the fund, which seeks to invest in high-growth local companies, has been under a cloud since Blue Sky went into receivership in May.
It was appointed in mid-2017, and has overseen three investments worth a total of $6 million. As revealed by The Advertiser in May, Blue Sky is being paid about $1 million a year to manage the fund, for a total of up to $12.5 million over 15 years. In response to questions this week about the future management of the fund, Treasurer Rob Lucas said a new fund manager was being sought.
“The independent committee that manages the SA Venture Capital Fund has commenced a process to appoint a new venture capital fund manager to oversee investments of the $50 million SA Venture Capital Fund,’’ Mr Lucas said.
He said that based on advice from the independent management committee overseeing the fund, the current team – headed by Blue Sky’s Elaine Stead – will continue to manage the fund “but as employees of a new yet-to-be appointed fund manager’’.
“I am advised the team has continued to manage the SA Venture Capital Fund effectively – notwithstanding the events that have impacted its parent company over the past year – and has met all its obligations under the terms of the management agreement,’’ Mr Lucas said.
“They have evaluated more than 350 investment opportunities and actively manage $6 million into three investments in the fund. The independent SAVCF management committee expects this level of activity to continue.”The Advertiser has repeatedly asked for a report, due at the end of each end financial year, which the fund manager is required to produce, setting out its activities. That has not been forthcoming.
