AUSTRALIANS wanting to work in London have been thrown a coronavirus lifeline, with a new deal to extend visas.
The British Government will allow Australians who had already signed up for a Tier 5 visa, allocated for people in their 20s, to delay their arrival for up to a year.
The deal, which was brokered following lobbying from the Australian High Commission in London, means that Australiansâ€™ UK dreams will not be cut short.
Travel bans on people leaving Australia meant many of those who had already signed up for a visa feared their two-year stay in the UK would be crimped. Under the deal, a person who had a visa due to start this month could delay its start date until May 2021 without penalty. The two-year clock would start once they had arrived and picked up their British residency permit.
