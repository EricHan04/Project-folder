Somark
ADELAIDE, Oct 20 AAP - A company developing technology to improve early medical tests is setting down roots in Adelaide, the South Australian government says.
About 50 jobs will be created when Somark, which has a presence in Sydney, the UK and the US, is setting up operations in Tonsley with help from a state government grant.
Somark is developing a system to better connect test animals used in pre-clinical medical research with data-recording equipment, leading to faster trials involving fewer animals.
