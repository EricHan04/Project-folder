HOUSEHOLDS can save up to $750 a year on their electricity bills by shopping around for a better deal, new analysis shows.
The St Vincent de Paul Society has created a computer system to compare post-July offers from 26 electricity retailers and eight gas providers.
It shows a South Australian family using 6000kWh a year is paying between $1805 and $2557 for electricity depending on which retailer they use.
The Vinnies annual report on SA power and gas prices shows the gas supply saving for people consuming an average 21,000MJ a year is more modest, with the lowest price $1030 and the highest $1204.
Vinnies spokesman Gavin Dufty said, overall, SA average electricity prices had dropped $155 during the 2020/21 financial year but much larger savings were possible.
“People need to make the most of these falling electricity costs to make sure the money ends up in your pockets, not the pockets of the energy industry,” he said “There is potentially up to $750 on the table every year, which is a considerable amount for families that budget.” The price-comparison tool, which is available to everyone, was designed to be used by South Australian charity financial advisers to come up with the best deal, depending on kWh usage, discounts and the ability of clients to pay on time.
Mr Dufty also warned householders to beware of fixed supply charges, which vary by as much as $210 a year depending on the electricity provider.
Big winners in the electricity market are those who can afford solar systems that feed power back into the grid and trigger savings.
The Vinnies report shows households with solar systems can save up to $925 a year compared with non-solar customers.
On behalf of all the retailers, Australian Energy Council chief executive Sarah McNamara said consumers should be aware of the wide range of offers available when reading the Vinnies report.
The report only reveals a snapshot for homes using 6000kWh per annum, and figures can change from quarter to quarter, “Most importantly, this assessment highlights again that it is a very competitive market and there is value to consumers taking a few minutes out of their day to check that they are on the best deal for their circumstances,’’ Ms McNamara said.
She said the federal government’s EnergyMadeEasy website provided another independent tool for comparing power prices.
