THERE'S no stopping the success of Adelaide company Ready Steady Go Kids.
The company, which sets out to foster a love of sport among preschoolers, has welcomed its newest franchisee, sports enthusiast and SANFL umpire James Ralston. From next term Mr Ralston will be running classes in Morphettville and Goodwood and is looking forward to the challenge.
The Ready Steady Go Kids program operates from more than 70 locations across Australia and Singapore.
Physio-designed for children aged from two-and-a-half to six years old, the program aims to create positive attitudes to exercise with classes that cover the fundamentals of 10 different sports while developing age-appropriate motor skills. Kids learn about sportsmanship and cooperating with their peers, making the program a great precursor to school days ahead.
Mr Ralston will host a Ready Steady Go Kids trial day at the Marion Leisure Centre on Saturday, Oct 6. Visit readysteadygokids.com.au
