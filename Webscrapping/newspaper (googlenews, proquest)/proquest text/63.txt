SPORTING all-rounder Callum Park faced a dilemma earlier this month every child dreams about and dreads.
The talented Plympton Park 12-year-old was selected from thousands of young hopefuls to represent SA in the under-12 national Aussie rules championships in August. But, just as the PHOS-Camden Football Club on-baller was readying himself to take on the Big V, he was phoned with another offer.
Callum had been picked to represent Australia in the US in the Cal Ripken World Series junior baseball championship - the event clashing with the Aussie rules championships.
"I was a bit sad because I had to choose between my two favourite sports because I love them both," he says.
"But it was also really, really exciting because I couldn't believe I was going to get the chance to go to America to play for Australia.
"I got some advice that it was a pretty special opportunity to play for Australia that I might never get again.
"With football, there will hopefully be more chances."
With that, the Adelaide Angels junior made up his mind and decided to don the green and gold in Baltimore next month.
