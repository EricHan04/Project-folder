WORK on a $12 million overhaul of Strathalbyn’s aged care centre will start mid next year, in a move community leaders hope will plug a gap in local health care.
The Strathalbyn and District Aged Care Facility, attached to the town’s hospital, will get an extra 36 aged care beds. That work is backed by $8 million in state funding and another $4 million from the Federal Government.
The centre already has 56 beds for aged care residents, but Alexandrina Mayor Keith Parkes said the revamp would help address a critical need for more, after the State Government shut Kalimna Hostel, across the road, in 2017. Its closure followed concerns about noncompliance with fire safety regulations and the Australian building code.
The move left the community well short of space to accommodate its ageing residents, Mr Parkes said.
“They got moved all over the place – only two or three people from Kalimna got moved into the hospital and all the other residents got moved out into other places,” he said.
“Their families and friends, instead of being able to visit them, just weren’t around and it was too far to go.” The State Government has also set aside $1 million towards reopening Kalimna. Mr Parkes hoped the revamp would include a community centre for ageing residents.
The Tonsley-based Global Centre for Modern Ageing and Australian Centre for Social Innovation are working with the State Government on plans for the town’s aged care precinct. “I think it’s exciting and fantastic for Strathalbyn,” Mr Parkes said.
Meanwhile, construction is expected to begin later this year on a new $15 million “luxury” aged care facility at Coorong Quays, Hindmarsh Island.A spokeswoman for Health Minister Stephen Wade said the total cost to reopen Kalimna was yet to be determined.
