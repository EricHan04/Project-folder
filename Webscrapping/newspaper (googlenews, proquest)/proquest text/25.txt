ADELAIDE baseballer Darren White enjoyed a big few days last weekend. After sharing in the birth of his first daughter, Molly, on Friday, White took the field with the Adelaide Angels against Woodville on Sunday. If he was recovering from sleepless nights, he certainly didn't show it, helping Adelaide to a 24-2 win against the Senators. White was able to join the celebrations with a home run in the third innings. To be fair, Woodville's usually young side was even younger, with players missing at national youth tournaments in progress.
