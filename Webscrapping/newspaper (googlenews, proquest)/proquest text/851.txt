POLLSA STARTUP
ADELAIDE, Feb 14 AAP - A South Australian Liberal government would spend $500,000 to help alleviate what Opposition Leader Steven Marshall says is the state's devastating brain drain crisis.
Mr Marshall on Friday said if the party won the March election it would establish an Adelaide StartUp Week to foster and support start-ups and small entrepreneurial businesses.
The event would include high-level international speakers and would aim at providing greater support for young entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into viable SA businesses.
Mr Marshall said people were leaving SA because it was too expensive and difficult to build startup businesses.
"I want to see people, especially young people, stay here in South Australia, contributing to and participating in our economy," he said.
