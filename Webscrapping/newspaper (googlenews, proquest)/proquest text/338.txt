HE’S a technological whizz – his speciality augmented reality – and he’s just been named the South Australian Young Entrepreneur Scheme’s (SAYES) Entrepreneur of the Year.
Alex Tolson, who with his sister Laura, runs Lateral Vision took out the title at a graduation ceremony held at SAHMRI last night. The siblings began their business, which specialises in interactive and immersive videography, in a granny flat in suburban Adelaide before moving to a business incubator at Flinders University’s New Venture Institute at Tonsley.
Mr Tolson recently completed the 12-month SAYES program, aimed at helping young South Aussies turn their business concepts into reality – and also focusing on creating a sustainable model for newly-established enterprises.
Participants, aged from 18 to 35, are mentored and given help to develop business plans as part of the program, delivered by Business SA and subsidised by the Department for Industry and Skills. Business SA Manager of Learning Solutions Kerry Sutton said the recently-graduated students represented the state’s “fresh face of commerce” across a range of emerging industries.
Mr Tolson has spoken in the past of the passion for his work and business. “We love all things technology and finding ways to get the most out of the current technologies available, always with an eye to the future,” he said.He was also awarded the Business Growth Award while the Business Plan and Mentor of the Year awards, went to Melissa Little of VENYU and Graeme Alder from Alders Business Consulting respectively.
