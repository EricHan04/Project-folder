TECH startup whiz Chhai Thach is adding another company to his rapidly growing portfolio in Adelaide.
Mr Thach and co-founder Steve Barrett have launched Furio, a business focusing on building and investing in early stage tech startups to work on turning innovative ideas into functioning businesses.
The two have drawn software, brand developer and interface designer Mars El-Bougrini on board to com-plement the team.
Mr Thach decided to pull their experience together into Furio after being approached by a growing number of entrepreneurs pitching ideas and requesting help in getting their potential businesses operating.
"We specialise in developing early stage concepts," Mr Thach said. "If people have an idea, if they don't know how to get started it's not going to work.
"We want to come in and help them build to being viable, to show them how to go and get customers, to connect with investors or advisers or mentors, there's no point in having a good idea if nothing happens." Mr Thach, who is the driving force behind the highly successful Marjoran co-working space for tech startups along with the brains behind the inaugural SouthStart Adelaide startup conference, already runs another business Getyo, with Mr Barrett.
The company's Getyo app helps users find nearby places that have custom rewards and offers. Furio would expect potential clients to pitch their ideas, with Mr Thach saying the team intended being selective in who they worked with to ensure they were more likely to make their startups a success.
"People think 'I'll build this app, put it in the app store and millions of people will download it', but with a new business, that's not going to happen," Mr Thach said.
One of his other startup interests, the Marjoran co-working space where he is founder, director and president, continues to swell after it was launched almost two years ago.It has moved from its first city space and now has 45 people workingk in Grenfell St.
