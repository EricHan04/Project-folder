WASHINGTON: The White House, busy with its annual Easter Egg Roll, also managed to pull off an April Fools' Day prank.
The White House Twitter account announced on Monday to be on the lookout for a "special video message from the president". Instead, viewers got a surprise visitor to the press briefing room. The piece began with a shot of the familiar lectern. It was empty as the presidential entrance march played. Then a small head peeked over the edge.
"It looks like you were expecting somebody else."
Indeed. It was Robbie Novak, who plays "Kid President" in a series of popular YouTube videos.
"April Fools on all of you all," he said.
