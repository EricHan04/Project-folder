TOMORROW is the opening of the Baseball SA division one season, with two blockbusters to whet supporters' appetites after a seven month lay-off.
After claiming the premiership last season, Kensington Cardinals will host the previous flag-holders Port Adelaide Magpies, in a game expected to go down to the wire.
The other big game sees Glenelg Tigers, who surprised in not making last season's grand final, start with a home game against Golden Grove Central District Dodgers, after breathing life into the competition with a breakthrough season of highs.
In other games, Goodwood Indians host Northern Districts Reds, Adelaide Angels head for Peregrine Park to face Southern Districts Hawks, Sturt Saints will be at home against Henley & Grange Rams, while West Torrens Eagles head to Woodville to take on the Senators.
Sunday's games starting at 3pm (home team named first): Glenelg v GGCD, Goodwood v Northern Districts, Kensington v Port Adelaide, Southern Districts v Adelaide, Sturt v Henley & Grange, Woodville v West Torrens, East Torrens bye.
