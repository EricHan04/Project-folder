ADELAIDE-based energy storage company 1414 degrees has been recognised for its innovative technology at this year’s CORE Hot 30.
The company took out the state-based SA innovation category for its SiBox thermal energy storage technology, which harnesses the properties of silicon to provide high-temperature energy storage and regeneration.
The CORE Hot 30 awards are hosted each year by the CORE Innovation Hub, which showcases innovation in the energy, mining and resources sectors.
This year’s top prize, the innovator of the year award, went to Queensland-based Grease Boss, which tracks and traces the greasing status of individual grease points using a cloud-based application, ensuring machinery outages can be avoided.
CORE National Innovation Hub manager Renee Hakendorf said that this year’s winners had all used innovation to solve real-world problems, improving capabilities in their industries.
“Many of these businesses have started small and are still growing, however, they’ve been able to contribute to significant advancements in their field on a national and international scale,” Ms Hakendorf said. As part of the program, CORE Hot 30 winners will receive industry recognition, brand-building opportunities, business growth training and mentoring.
