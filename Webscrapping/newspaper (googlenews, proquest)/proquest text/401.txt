AN Adelaide technology company has come to the aid of stressed parents facing at least a week of school closures with a free learning-at-home course for young students.
Makers Empire has created the 3D learning program in response to Wednesday’s ruling for schools to shut as part of South Australia’s six-day lockdown.
It comprises 90 3D design challenges designed for children from kindergarten to Year 6 and is aligned to the Australian school curriculum.
Makers Empire co-founder Roland Peddie said students could complete the design challenges as quickly or as slowly as they like, with minimal or no parent assistance, making them an ideal lockdown activity.
“Most of us at Makers Empire are parents of school-age children and it’s a worrying and unsettling time for kids who are missing their usual school and activities,” he said.
“The Makers Empire learning-at-home course … (is) ideal for helping young kids to feel engaged, stimulated and empowered.” Makers Empire’s products are used in more than 200 SA primary schools, and by more than 1.9 million students in more than 40 countries.
