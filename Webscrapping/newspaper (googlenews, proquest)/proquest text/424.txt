TECHNOLOGY company Makers Empire is developing a foothold in the Middle East, with its software soon to be used in more than 200 schools in the United Arab Emirates.
The Adelaide-based company has secured a deal with the country’s Ministry of Education to roll out its technology and curriculum – used with 3D printers – into 235 schools early next year.
Makers Empire chief executive Jon Soong said staff would travel to the UAE in January to work with teachers on using the technology.
It aims to help develop children’s design and critical- thinking skills, through solving everyday problems.
“Kids are so good with this type of technology if you give them the opportunity to try it,” Mr Soong said.
“You’ll definitely find someone for whom it will become their passion and they’ll run with it and do great things.” Among projects local children had perfected using the technology was a bird feeder, he said.
Others designed a maths mascot which helped engage students in a subject that hadn’t previously been on top of everyone’s list of favourite classes.
“They all had their own avatar they’d bring out every maths lesson,” Mr Soong said.
“They’re small things but they all have an impact in their own way. “They’re learning the skills … but also with a very relevant technology that will feature in their futures.” Mr Soong said the deal with the UAE, using 3D printers supplied by Dubai-based education consultancy company Ibtikar, was a great win for the company.
“It’s a significant validation point for us and it’s one of the larger deals we’ve had,” Mr Soong said.
The curriculum will begin at Year 7 level, but is expected to be rolled out to younger students in future.
Makers Empire, based in the CBD, started about four years ago and now employs about 15 full-time staff and three casual employees.“That will hopefully grow very fast and we’re hoping to double our size in the next 18 months,” Mr Soong said.
