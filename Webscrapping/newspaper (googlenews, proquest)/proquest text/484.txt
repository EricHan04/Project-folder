AUSTRALIA will have an extended sample of life after Glenn McGrath, by entering the first phase of a crammed 18-month schedule without its spearhead.
The man who has underpinned Australia's world-conquering attack for the past decade will be sidelined until at least December after re-injuring his left ankle.
He will miss Australia's two-Test series against Zimbabwe starting at the WACA on Thursday and the one-day tournament in India later this month.
Given New South Wales' barren Pura Cup program in late November- early December, he is also in danger of missing the first two home Tests against India in December. It is expected McGrath will have surgery on the troublesome joint this week.
The veteran speedster said he feared the worst after pulling up sore while bowling during the national squad's pre-series camp in Perth on Saturday.
"To hope that would disappear overnight was probably asking a little bit much," McGrath said.
"It's at the stage where it is quite painful. I'd rather go into a Test series 100 per cent.
"I don't think it's fair on myself or the rest of my team- mates."
The setback means McGrath will be denied his wish of playing his 100th Test on Boxing Day.
West Australian speedster Brad Williams, who was called into Australia's 13-man squad last week, has now come into strong contention for a Test berth. He will vie for the fourth bowling spot with leg-spinner Stuart McGill.
