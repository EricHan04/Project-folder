BEER brewed and cooled from the sun will be one of the results of a $40 million investment in renewable energy at the Tonsley precinct.
The solar and batteries project, formally opened yesterday, will supply 30 per cent of the energy usage at Tonsley.
Tenants – including the micro-brewery being established by the owners of the Lady Burra Brewhouse – will be offered a discount on standing electricity contracts if they sign up for the service.
Enwave Australia will own and run the scheme in partnership with ZEN Energy, which is installing the solar panels.
Opening the project, Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said power would be available to businesses in the precinct and residents of the Tonsley village. “The Tonsley District Energy Scheme demonstrates South Australia’s leadership in the renewable energy sector,” he said.
The micro-brewery is expected to be among the project’s customers, Enwave chief executive Cameron Evans said.
The solar and battery elements were part of an overall energy management scheme. “The scheme can be increased and we plan on increasing the scale as demand for electricity grows in the precinct,” Mr Evans, pictured, said.
ZEN Energy chief executive Marc Barrington said the project was the company’s biggest solar installation.In the first stage, 7400 solar panels are being installed to provide 2.34MW of power. In future, this will increase 20,000 panels and 6MW, with a 4MW battery still under design. There are 35 businesses and organisations at Tonsley, employing 17,000 people on site in addition to about 6000 TAFE and Flinders University students.
