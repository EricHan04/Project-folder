AN unbeaten 83 by all-rounder Abdul Razzaq saved Pakistan from another embarrassing batting display at the WACA Ground yesterday.
After crumbling to 5/78 before lunch, the Pakistanis recovered to be all out for 262 on the opening day of their four-day clash against Western Australia.
The hosts will resume today at 1/20 after a withering three-over spell from speedster Shoaib Akhtar.
Shoaib trapped Test opener Justin Langer lbw for four with his fifth ball of the innings and had another confident shout against Chris Rogers turned down.
Razzaq was a model of patience, soaking up 198 deliveries in an innings that lasted nearly four-and-a-half hours.
He shared in a 95-run stand with vice-captain Yousuf Youhana (77) and later partnered Mohammad Sami (21) to put on 72 for the eighth wicket.
Desperate for batting practice before next week's first Test against Australia, Pakistan was earlier thwarted by a pair of rookie fast bowlers.
Brett Dorey and Ben Edmondson entered the match with just eight first-class games between them.
