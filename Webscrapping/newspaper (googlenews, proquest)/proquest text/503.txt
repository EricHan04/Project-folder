SWIMMING coach Scott Volkers says he is prepared to return to Australia if required to clear his name in the face of new investigations into alleged sexual abuse.
His comments come as Queensland's Director of Public Prosecutions considers whether there is sufficient evidence to lay new charges against Volkers for allegedly abusing three swimmers in the 1980s.
Volkers denies any wrongdoing. "Of course I will go back," said Volkers, now head swim coach at Brazil's Minas Tenis Clube.
"I'm not a fugitive. I'm a normal person. I go back to Australia every year." Julie Gilbert, Kylie Rogers and Simone Boyce alleged in the Child Sex Abuse Royal Commission earlier this year they were abused by Volkers between the ages of 12 and 14.
Their submission to the Queensland DPP in September to reopen the case was made with help from child advocacy group Bravehearts.
Calls to press new charges come 12 years after proceedings against the former Olympic coach of Susie O'Neill and Sam Riley were dropped by the DPP. The decision prompted a probe by Queensland's Crime And Misconduct Commission, which criticised the DPP's handling of the case.Volkers questioned how new charges could be laid without fresh evidence.
