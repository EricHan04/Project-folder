MEET the aspiring young South Australian engineers and architects who are creating incredible 3D models.
The prototypes they are inventing are designed to solve real-life problems, from how to stop sand getting on to the school basketball court to creating a wheelchair-friendly monkey bar – and even protecting the groundsman’s mobile phone from being run over by his mower.
Dozens of primary school students from across the state, including Keith in the South-East and Kangaroo Island, have showcased their concepts at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
They are among students from about 50 SA schools taking part in a joint project between the SA Education Department and Adelaide-based education technology company Makers Empire, in which students use 3D print software to develop their critical and creative thinking skills.
Makers Empire chief exectuive Jon Soong said it ws about providing children with skills they would be able to use in the future.
Prospect Primary School technology teacher Deanna Cammisotto said her students, in Years 3 and 4, were concerned classmates with disabilities couldn’t use – or were wary of – the main playground.“The students asked their classmates what they’d like included … they added things such sensory play areas (a music maker) and removed the bark, to allow wheelchair access and then created a playground to scale,” she said.
