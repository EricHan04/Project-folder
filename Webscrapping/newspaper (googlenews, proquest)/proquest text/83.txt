JACK Buckskin loves the idea that his hand-carved boomerang – which is on a mission to the International Space Station – is in the ”sky world with our Aboriginal ancestors”.
The weapon – which the Kaurna artist has carved from western myall wood – has been taken into space by astronaut Dr Shannon Walker, the wife of Adelaide’s Andy Thomas.
“We talk about connections with Aboriginal people, we talk about land, sea and sky and it is pretty crazy that something that has been handmade down here is up in the … sky world with our Aboriginal ancestors,” Mr Buckskin said.
Meanwhile, Premier Steven Marshall will today announce the state’s bid for the 2024 International Astronautical Congress attended by 4000 delegates.
Andy Thomas Space Foundation chief executive Nicola Sasanelli said the 2017 event had been the origin of the space industry in SA. “A congress in 2024 will have an even greater impact on the growth of our space industry,” she said.
