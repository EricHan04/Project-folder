REIGNING premier Glenelg tackles big improvers Adelaide Angels in division one baseball's game of the round tomorrow at the Bay.
Adelaide has increased its depth behind the big bats of Duncan Izaaks and Ty Forney, while it has a strong pitching line-up. The Tigers have a reliable starter in Hayden McGeary, while reliever Matt Williams has been doing the job.
At Payneham, East Torrens will be looking to get back in the winners' list when it hosts Port Adelaide, while Southern Districts will have its work cut out when Goodwood Indians visit.
Kensington should be too strong for Golden Grove Central Districts, as will West Torrens against Northern Districts, in away fixtures.Tomorrow's games (home team named first), 3pm: East Torrens v Port Adelaide, Glenelg v Adelaide, GGCD v Kensington, Northern Districts v West Torrens, Southern Districts v Goodwood.
