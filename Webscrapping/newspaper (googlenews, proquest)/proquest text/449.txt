FORMER Adelaide and Fremantle forward Tony Modra has lodged an injury compensation claim with WorkCover in a move that could have repercussions for other injured sports stars.
A Supreme Court ruling in Adelaide last week has opened the door for South Australian-based sportspeople injured between 1991 and 1999 to claim WorkCover compensation.
Modra has requested an undisclosed compensation for the serious knee injury he suffered while playing for Adelaide in the 1997 preliminary final against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG.
His manager Max Stevens said a monetary figure had not yet been put on Modra's claim.
"We haven't got to that yet, it's still in it's early stages," Stevens said.
Stevens said the claim was based on the assertion Modra never fully recovered from the injury.
"He struggled with the knee after the reconstruction and was dropped for the Grand Final side that won the flag the following season," Stevens said.
"Then he moved to Fremantle to try to resurrect his career.
"If not for the injury he could have had a couple of top years left at Adelaide.
Stevens likened the injury to one sustained in a road accident.
"There is also the psychological affect of the trauma the injury had on him," he said.
"It's like having a serious car accident. You never come back the same."
Stevens is investigating whether former West Coast Eagles premiership player Shane Bond was eligible for compensation.
Bond injured a knee while playing for Port Adelaide at the SCG in the late 1990s.
A WorkCover spokesperson said WorkCover was "reviewing the implications of the decision".
