MOIRA Were’s unstinting efforts to support female entrepreneurs and close the gender investment gap were recognised recently, with a group of collaborators surprising her with a bequest of $20,000.
More than 130 supporters contributed to the Equity Weaver Fund 2022, with Ms Were surprised on stage with the recognition at the recent SouthStart conference.
Ms Were founded the Hen House Co-Op in 2019, a platform designed to help close the gender investment gap, and also founded the Chooks SA Facebook group, which has more than 3000 members committed to backing female entrepreneurs.
She is also on the state government’s Entrepreneurship Advisory Board and was a co-founder of social enterprise Collab4Good.
Kate Simpson, the lead conspirator behind the recognition, said Ms Were was doing “more influential and effective work than she’s ever done before’’.
“She’s intentionally setting out to only do the work that will be the most impactful in terms of gender equity,” Ms Simpson said. “She’s going into empty spaces that need addressing. A lot of us have benefited from the way Moira works and feel this work is important for us.’’
