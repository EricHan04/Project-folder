THE man credited with pioneering the use of point-of-care, handheld ultrasound devices in the United States has been appointed chief executive of Adelaide medical devices company Signostics.
Kevin Goodwin, former chief executive of ultrasound company Sonosite for 17 years, will be based in Seattle.
Signostics sees the US as a key market for its handheld ultrasound and bladder scanners.
In January it won US regulatory approval for its bladder product, which will be launched internation-ally at a major urology conference next month. The handheld ultrasound, SignosRT, is delivering strong returns, with Signostics' revenues growing 200 per cent to $3.89 million in the year to the end of September.
Mr Goodwin takes on the role left vacant by Warren Ortmann who quit in December. Sonosite was acquired by FujiFilm in 2012 for almost $US1 billion. Mr Goodwin left the company in April last year."There are so many opportunities to move ultrasound forward through innovation," he said.
