GREG Lesnikowski and Krystal Bishop have combined to claim a small chunk of South Australian thoroughbred racing history at Morphettville.
Yesterday’s metropolitan card was the first South Australian race meeting to be broadcast on free-to-air TV after the start of a landmark media-rights deal between Thoroughbred Racing SA and Racing.com.
Bishop rode the Lesnikowski-trained Xaarian to win the opening race under the new seven-year deal, the vision streamed into homes on Seven West Media’s Channel 78.
“Yes, I’ve got the first winner with Racing.com and I’m leading the trainers’ premiership, too,” Strathalbyn-based Lesnikowski joked, the race also the first of the 2017-18 SA racing season.
Xaarian, having just his seventh start, certainly showed enough to suggest yesterday’s win in the Holdfast Insurance Maiden (2025m) wouldn’t be his last.
The four-year-old gelding, on the third line of betting at $4.40, settled just off the pace then proved too strong in the straight, bullocking clear to win by two lengths. The Greg Dunn-trained Midrada ($91) fought on for second, two lengths clear of the favourite Unflynnching ($2.50), who loomed as the likely winner on the home turn but only battled in the run to the line.
“He went super today,” Bishop said. “We’ve done a lot of work with him and finally got everything right. He’s settling beautifully and I think there’s more to come.” Lesnikowski and Bishop didn’t have to wait long to return to the winner’s stall, with four-year-old mare Hilumiere prevailing two races later.
Then Bishop’s memorable day continued when the Barry Brook-trained Sasun fought on gamely to win the Irish Raceday Handicap, giving the injury plagued 24-year-old hoop her first city treble.“I couldn’t ask for any more ... and especially for trainers who have really supported me,” she said.
