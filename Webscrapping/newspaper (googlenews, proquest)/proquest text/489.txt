The AFL's Aboriginal players are in Broome at a camp intended to help indigenous players focus on their lives after football.
A total of 35 players, including Adelaide's Andrew McLeod, Brisbane's Chris Johnson and Sydney's Adam Goodes, are at the four- day indigenous camp.
One young participant, Richmond's Andrew Krakouer, described the camp as "awesome".
"It's great that the AFLPA are so prepared to help us out with traineeships and education that will help us when our careers have finished," he said.
"I love being around all the guys. I look up to a lot of these boys here, the older ones. It's really good to get to know them because other than a brief chat after games we don't really get the chance to do that," he said.
"Some of the older blokes have played a lot more games than we have and are a lot more experienced but they're easy to approach and talk to them very easily."
It's still more than four months before another ball is kicked in anger for premiership points, but already a buzz has descended on Punt Rd according to Krakouer, who said new coach Terry Wallace had sent morale skyrocketing.
"He's made a really good impression and there's a great feel at the club now." Krakouer said Wallace was "obviously well respected by everybody for what he has achieved in football". "Everyone I've spoken to have only had good things to say about him. We haven't had a lot of success over the last couple of years but hopefully that's about to change. It's like a fresh new start for everybody."
The Tigers have five of the first 20 selections in Saturday's national draft - the first team in the 19-year history of the draft to do so.
