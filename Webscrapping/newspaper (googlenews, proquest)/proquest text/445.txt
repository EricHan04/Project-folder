THE WA woman tragically killed in a horrific car crash near Mount Gambier, which has also left an eight-year-old boy critically injured, was a “bright and bubbly” human resources manager in the mining industry.
Guildford woman Clare Merriam and her partner Michael Place had recently travelled to Victoria to see his three children and the tragedy unfolded during a trip to Mount Gambier on Friday afternoon, the West Australian reported.
Ms Merriam, the driver, died at the scene while her partner’s eight-year-old son, who was sitting in the back seat, suffered critical injuries.
Mr Place, who was in the passenger’s seat, and his six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter were also seriously injured.
The father and his two less seriously injured children were taken to the local hospital for treatment.
Ms Merriam, a 38-year-old people and engagement manager at Gold Fields goldmining company, was described as a “kind, friendly and energetic woman”.
“She was just full of life,” the couple’s next-door neighbour Andy Aple told the West Australian.
“We’d see her walking her dog. She was very bright and bubbly, always keen for a chat.” Mr Place’s most seriously injured child is understood to remain in a critical condition at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
Emergency services were called to the crash, south of Mount Gambier, about 12.30pm following reports of a collision between a truck and a car.
Major crash investigators arrived at the fatal crash outside Mount Gambier at 6pm.
The truck driver, a 58– year-old man, was uninjured and is helping police with their inquiries. The intersection at Donovans Rd and Glenelg River Rd was closed while major crash investigators examined the scene.
