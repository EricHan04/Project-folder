WITH contrasting results last week, expected power teams Glenelg Tigers and Kensington Cardinals are set for an enthralling battle tomorrow at the Bay. While the Tigers managed a close win over Golden Grove Central Districts, Kensington went down to Port Adelaide in a slugfest. Another interesting match-up will be with last week's big improvers Sturt and Woodville, at the Saints home ground, while Goodwood seems to have another easy assignment when it hosts Henley & Grange. The Magpies should have too much firepower for Adelaide Angels, and Southern Districts will be too strong for Northern Districts.
Games from 3pm (home team first): Glenelg v Kensington, Goodwood v Henley & Grange, Port Adelaide v Adelaide, Southern Districts v Northern Districts, Sturt v Woodville, West Torrens v East Torrens, GGCD bye.
