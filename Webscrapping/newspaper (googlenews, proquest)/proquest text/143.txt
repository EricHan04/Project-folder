CRAWLING over red rocks in space suits or directing astronauts from a control room, students will soon be operating their own Mars missions at Hamilton Secondary College.
Construction of a $200,000 space school at the southern suburbs school is set to start within weeks.
A former science lab will be converted into three sections -- a domed room simulating the Martian surface complete with red dirt and rocks, a control room and a briefing room.
Year 7s from other schools will access the space centre through an outreach program.
Hamilton principal Peta Kourbelis said it would allow for integration of all four elements of STEM learning -- science, technology, engineering and maths -- within a space theme.
Ms Kourbelis said students in the control room would use special computer software to communicate with those on "Mars" as they collected samples, while others would design and drive robot rovers to explore the Martian surface.
The control room will also be used to Skype with astronauts from NASA and the European Space Agency, who already make visits to the school each year.
The college has been working with the Victorian Space Science Education Centre, where SA students have visited for holiday camps, to develop the curriculum to be used at Hamilton when the space school opens next year.
"We're excited to be at the forefront of delivering such an amazing program to students from not only Hamilton Secondary College, but also to students (from other schools) who attend as part of the outreach program," Ms Kourbelis said.Education Department acting executive director of learning improvement Deonne Smith said the space school "models the type of rich learning we want all students studying STEM to experience".
