ADELAIDE seed capital provider Playford Capital last night celebrated reaching the $100 million mark in investment and support for SA businesses.
The State Government-supported organisation provides seed funding of up to $1.2 million and advice to companies in the start-up phase. Chief executive Amanda Heyworth said yesterday Playford had provided $19.6 million itself and linked companies with more than $80 million in co-investment.
So far 42 companies have been helped with funding support and more than 800 have received business advice.
"Playford Capital has been instrumental in attracting a total of $103.1 million to innovative South Australian companies since 2001," Ms Heyworth said. "This represents a return of more than $7 for every dollar contributed by the South Australian Government in nine years."
Playford was created to provide funding for companies looking for investment of between $500,000 and $3 million - an area that Ms Heyworth has previously labelled the "valley of death", where the funding amounts are too large for early stage government funding, but too small for larger investors.
Firms that have been funded by Playford include Adelaide success story Signostics, which has developed a hand-held ultrasound device, and Embertec, which is developing power-saving technology for homes and businesses.
It also supported Maxamine, an online website optimisation company that was acquired in 2008 by international consulting firm Accenture. Playford celebrated the milestone last night at a function at the Royal Institution of Australia.
