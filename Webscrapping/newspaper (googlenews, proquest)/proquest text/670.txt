THEBARTON biotechnology company Signostics expects to launch its second generation hand-held ultrasound device to US, European and Australian markets in 2012.
With the help of a $1.96 million commercialisation grant from the Australian Government, to be matched by the company, Signostics will bring its prototype mobile real-time ultrasound device to a "large potential market", improving on its present static-image machine Signos, which retails for $US3300.
Signos, launched in 2009, is the smallest, most affordable ultrasound device in the world.
"It's hard to guess the size of a market that doesn't really exist," Signostics chief executive Dr Neil Bartlett said.
"But the global market for ultrasound imaging is worth $US5 billion and the fastest-growing segment is hand-carried devices (laptop-sized) worth $US1 billion." Present customers included hospitals and private practitioners in the US, Europe and Australia but the machine had potential for medical providers in developing countries, Dr Bartlett said.
"The US is the world's biggest medical device market but World Health Organisation figures show that three quarters of the world's population has no access to medical imaging," he said.
Signostics was the major beneficiary of $18 million worth of commercialisation grants that were awarded by the Government to 19 companies this month.
Dr Bartlett said the company also had gone to its shareholders to fund the commercialisation of the latest device.
Co-founded by Dr Bartlett and his brother Stewart Bartlett in 2005, the biotechnology company opened a sales and marketing office in Palo Alto, California, in 2008.
