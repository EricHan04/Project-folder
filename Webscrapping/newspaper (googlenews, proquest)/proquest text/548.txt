A SIMPLE blood test for stomach cancer could give new hope for early detection, Australian researchers say.
Associate Professor Peter Hoffmann, director of Adelaide University's Adelaide Proteomics Centre, said researchers had identified four new proteins that change in concentration in the blood of stomach cancer patients.
If large clinical trials succeed, a test costing $30-50 could be 3-5 years away. Stomach cancer is the world's fourth-most common, and the second leading cause of cancer death.The research was done in collaboration with Associate Professor Matthias Ernst of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.
