READY Steady Go Kids has opened a northern suburbs branch of its ever-popular multi-sport program for preschoolers.
The classes, run in Surrey Downs, are great news for children living in the immediate area and surrounding suburbs.
Run by experienced and highly trained instructors, the Ready Steady Go Kids franchise is Australia's largest program of its kind and is held at more than 50 locations nationally.
At a time when childhood obesity is a very real problem for Australian children, it is a great way to promote a healthy lifestyle from an early age.
The program teaches children from 2 1/2 to six years the fundamentals of 10 sports in a social, non-competitive environment.
While focused on developing age-appropriate motor skills, the program also introduces the concept of sportsmanship by encouraging children to take turns, play by the rules and co-operate with their peers.
Surrey Downs sessions of the program designed by physiotherapists will be on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday mornings in Term 1.
Enrolments are now open and vacancies are filling fast, so parents are encouraged to act quickly to avoid disappointment.
"We're looking forward to welcoming children from all around the northern suburbs," Ready Steady Go Kids director Stuart Derbyshire said.
"We currently run classes at 11 other locations throughout Adelaide, but there is definitely a demand for the program in suburbs like Golden Grove."
"We're passionate about what we do and want as many children as possible to experience the benefits (of) our program."
