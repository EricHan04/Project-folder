THE first workers at the Tonsley TAFE are expected to be on site early next month - a sign that the flagship manufacturing precinct is moving from construction to ordinary economic activity.
"The TAFE - the Sustainable Industries Education Centre - is almost done," Manu-facturing, Innovation and Trade Minister Tom Kenyon said. "They will open for classes next term." Tonsley, the former Mitsubishi factory bought by taxpayers, is intended to be an advanced manufacturing precinct combining education, industry, retail and residential.
Several hundred workers are on site. The old factory has been stripped back to its metal framework and extensive civil works are in progress.
Not far behind the TAFE, will be the Flinders University satellite campus for engineering. The first few floors have been laid and columns built.
The first commercial tenant - data storage company Tier 5 - has a showcase installation in the former Mitsubishi 380 stamping hall. Ground has been cleared for Siemens.
"Requests for interest on a developer for the residential component have gone out," Mr Kenyon said. "Over time it will be a really good spot to live." A delegation of Chinese investors visited Tonsley last week. "They're interested in real estate investment but would like to have people ready to move in and rent from them," Mr Kenyon said."So that gives us some financing opportunities, businesses could get a long-term lease and not have to tie up their capital. They could even sell an existing building if they own one and move there."
