Local tech company Voxon Photonics has attracted global attention after completing the world’s first international holographic video call – between Adelaide and London.
And with the right corporate partner on board, the company believes it can deliver a mainstream roll-out of the holographic video call technology to the public within 18 months.
The world-first event was broadcast live on BBC’s Digital Planet radio program in London.
Voxon co-founder Gavin Smith conversed in real-time with a 3D holographic image of business partner Will Tamblyn.
Mr Tamblyn, who was set up at the company’s New Venture Institute HQ at Flinders University, appeared in hologram form before a panel of tech experts and a studio audience of 300 people.
He said the call “could not have run any better”.
The two Voxon founders joined forces about 12 years ago, inspired by a vision to re-create the 3D holograms made famous in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.In June, the company launched the world’s first 3D holographic arcade machine.
