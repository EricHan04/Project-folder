CITIMARK Properties has upgraded to new national headquarters in Brisbane's CBD as part of an expansion plan to tap into interstate development opportunities.
The Queensland-based developer has leased 573sq m on Level 16 of the Central Plaza One building on Queen St -- relocating from its former, smaller premises in Fortitude Valley.
Citimark has signed a seven-year lease of the space at a rate of $390/sq m.
The move comes as Citimark starts construction of a $120 million, 37-level residential tower on the corner of Tank St and North Quay.
Hutchinson Builders has been appointed to build Evolution, which already has 47 per cent of its apartments under contract.
The move to Central Plaza One was negotiated on behalf of Citimark by tenancy advocate Marcus Gaffney of Trident Corporation.
Citimark joint managing director Robert Pullar said the company wanted a presence in the CBD, which would allow it to focus on seeking out opportunities in Sydney and Melbourne and identifying further ventures in South Australia.
Citimark has recently broadened its presence in regional markets in Queensland, NSW and South Australia.
"We're currently investigating prospective developments in Sydney," he said.
"Work is under way on a 25ha industrial and business park on the former Mitsubishi engine plant site in Lonsdale in Adelaide's southern suburbs, and over the past six months the company has undertaken new developments in regional Queensland and NSW.
"The move also provides for future growth in staff numbers and means we can now cope with the expected escalation of the company."
He said the decision to base Citimark in the CBD was also part of the company's intention to retain southeast Queensland as its core focus.
"Southeast Queensland is the fastest growing region in Australia and we see its sustained international and interstate migration and strong economic growth driving almost unlimited development opportunities," he said.
