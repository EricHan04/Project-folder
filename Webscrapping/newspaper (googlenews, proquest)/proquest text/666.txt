ADELAIDE medical device company Signostics has raised $5.5 million to help commercialise its palm-sized ultrasound product.
The company aims to capture a slice of the personal ultrasound market, which the company says is worth about $3.3 billion. This is the second capital raising within a year, following a $5.4 million raising last July.
Signostics has raised more than $21 million from venture capital firms, government grants and private investors.
The company's pocket-sized Signos ultrasound device, which retails for about $4000, is much cheaper than larger ultrasound devices, and portable. This allows doctors to perform diagnoses quickly in hospitals, but also at remote sites, such as patients' homes.
Signostics chief operating officer Stewart Bartlett said the money raised would help the company expand into new markets. "The additional capital will help us further develop our products and enable the company to build its brand and distribution channels in Australia and internationally," he said.
"What makes the Signos so appealing to general practice, primary care and emergency-medicine physicians is that it's a cost-effective solution enabling them to provide a higher level of service to their patients."
The capital raising was underwritten by Adelaide stockbroker Baker Young. Joint managing director Alan Young said investor response to the capital raising was "exceptional".
He said many early-stage companies found it hard to raise money. Baker Young was keen to continue to work with the company to help it tap into international and Australian funding sources, as well as industry expertise, he said.
