LUKE Jamieson of Website Boss gives some advice on creating the right shop-front for your business.
BE AWARE One thing I see all the time is business wanting an old-school style -- home, about us, what we do, etc.
Audiences aren't really that interested in the entire history of a business; they're more interested in how the business can solve their problem or provide what they need.
Think about what customers want and design the layout and flow of your website to guide the visitor from arriving at the site through to a purchase or inquiry.
THE COST?
Minimal to expensive. Expectations should centre on what to expect from your budget.
For those who want to edit their own site, there are low-cost platforms such as Squarespace or WordPress.
These generally have a monthly fee starting at around $29. You'll also need to pay for a domain name - which costs between $9 and $22 a year - and hosting place.
I also recommend a back-up, upgrade and monthly security service in case the site goes down, or gets hacked.
Expect to pay $5000 to $6000 for a professionally produced content managed site with about five pages of content, analytics, security and back-up. For e-commerce and online stores that bill can top $10,000.
DIY PROS AND CONS Pros: Cheap, they also look nice out of the box and hosting is managed for the business.Cons: May need design skills, might face limitations within the platform if you want to extend the site to include bookings, or certain design layouts that the platform doesn't do by default. Integrations such as CRM can cost.
