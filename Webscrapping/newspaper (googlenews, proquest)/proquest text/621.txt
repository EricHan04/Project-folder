AGRICULTURE Kangaroo Island celebrated a belated 25 years of service as the Island's peak body for agriculture at its biennial conference on Friday, where nearly 150 locals turned out to the Kingscote Town Hall to hear from some innovative speakers and local trades.
Guest speakers included MLA's Pheobe Johnson, who gave a world market update on lamb; neXtgen Agri co-founder Mark Ferguson on the 'future ewe'; Thrive Agri Services' Andrew Kennedy on optimising sheep production systems; Jigsaw Farms principal Mark Wootton on dealing with climate change; Achieve Ag consultant Nathan Scott on livestock biosecurity and traceability; and Nick Berry on his journey from a KI farm kid to growing his company Seed Terminator.
A panel also gave an update on the projects under way on KI, which included an overview of the forestry to farmland project, while local land management consultant Lyn Dohle, Rural Solutions SA, was presented with the first-ever AgKI life membership.
