Last week it was the Tigers 10-0, this time 12-2
FOR the second time in a week Glenelg handed Kensington a 10-run defeat on Saturday, this time winning 12-2.
Tristan Stevens was superb for the Tigers going five complete innings before being relieved by Chris Lawson who finished the game off for the easy victory.
The Glenelg offence was led by veteran third baseman Ben Dixon who collected three hits.
He was very well supported by Dan Wilson, Ben Hilterbrand and the home-run-hitting Jamie Kloeden.
Kensington has now lost three in a row and will welcome the return of the heart of its lineup in the form of Leigh Chenoweth, Craig Watts and Nick Talbot for its clash with top team Southern Districts this weekend.
Glenelg has been in good form and will need to be as it comes up against the big improvers this year, the Adelaide Angels.
Meanwhile, Port Adelaide was able to turn the tables and post a sound 7-4 win against Adelaide on Saturday.
The game was dominated by the Magpies' gun recruit, Ryan Murphy, who pitched eight innings and hit a three-run home-run and a two-run double to well and truly be the most valuable player on the park.
Adelaide sent its import pitcher Adam Hawes to the hill but he did not receive the run support required and was relieved by Justin Ellery.
After a slow start to the season Port has well and truly turned the corner and will look to solidify its spot near the top of the ladder in next weekend's double header against bottom team Northern Districts.
Adelaide must rebound quickly to prepare itself for a classic match-up with Glenelg.
Sturt topped off an excellent week winning its second game against the young Woodville outfit.
Sturt coach Tony Catt will be most pleased with his young charges as they put themselves in contention for an unlikely playoff berth.
