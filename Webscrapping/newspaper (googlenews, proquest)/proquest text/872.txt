THE search is on for this year’s top 10 technology start-up ideas that can help the defence sector.
Techstars Adelaide, which attracted hundreds of applications from 49 countries to run its program last year, is now accepting applications for its 2018 program.
Defence companies and organisations such as Boeing, Defence Australia, Saab Australia, Thales and Codan are supporting the 13-week mentor-driven program, managed by Chris Chang.
This year’s program from September to December is focused on drones, Internet of Things, big data, cyber security, sensors, and robotics.
Techstars Adelaide managing director Terry Gold said the program provided an opportunity to test ideas with industry as well as gain seed funding. The group will offer $20,000 in equity investment to each start-up besides further investment opportunities.SA is on the cusp of benefiting directly from the billions being spent on new defence projects. Last year’s participant Teamgage has since started working with Thales, DXC and NEC. Applications are open until May 13.
