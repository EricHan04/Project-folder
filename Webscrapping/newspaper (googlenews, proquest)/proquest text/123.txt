THE SA Produce Market has secured its own power supply with the installation of a $10.5 million energy plant on site.
The microgrid, supported by a $2.5 million State Government grant, includes more than 6400 solar panels, 25 Tesla power pack batteries and other infrastructure. At full capacity, the system is capable of generating energy equivalent to powering about 4500 homes. Work on the project started in December 2017.
The state’s primary fresh produce wholesale market trades more than 250,000 tonnes of produce annually across 45 wholesalers, 60 growers and hundreds of retail operators. SA Produce Market chief executive Angelo Demasi said the microgrid positioned the precinct to be completely self-sufficient in its energy supply with significant net savings. When compared to the current retail energy offers available locally, the savings amounted to about $4.3 million over 10 years, he said.
“This technology will enable SA Produce Market growers and wholesalers to continue to provide affordable fresh produce to local consumers who purchase through independent retailers,” Mr Demasi said.
“This innovative solution is a win-win for both consumers and the environment, leading the way for other South Australian businesses.” The system provides power to operators within the market and warehousing precinct, and was installed by contractors Autonomous Energy, AZZO and Schneider Electric.Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan launched the plant yesterday. “The microgrid is a measure of the forward thinking of the Produce Market and the opportunities that exist to deliver more affordable and reliable electricity,” he said.
