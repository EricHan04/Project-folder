AN UNCONQUERED 93 from Craig Wishart hoisted Zimbabwe towards a competitive first innings total in its three-day clash against Western Australia at the WACA Ground yesterday.
Wishart guided the tourists from a wobbly 5/89 to 7/254 at stumps on the opening day.
Suggestions the early start to the season would diminish the WACA's trademark bounce were quashed in the opening session. WA pacemen Jo Angel and Paul Wilson produced several rearing deliveries in a display that would have heartened Australia's pace-battery.
In the tourists' last match before the first Test starting in Perth next Thursday, the Africans were anything but impressive early on.
This was despite the absence of speedster Brad Williams and spinner Brad Hogg, who were unavailable due to Australia's pre- series camp.
The opening batting continues to be a vexed issue for the tourists with Dion Ebrahim (8) and Trevor Gripper (9) the latest combination to falter. No. 3 Mark Vermeulen (38) offered some resistance, as did Stuart Carlisle (17). But it was Wishart who provided the middle-order pulse.
Zimbabwe skipper Heath Streak offered valuable support late in the day with a defiant 45.
