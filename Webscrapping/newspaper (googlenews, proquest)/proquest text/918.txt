The South Australian Government has now released a master plan for the Tonsley Park site in Adelaide's south, vacated by car maker Mitsubishi.
It says the old assembly plant will become a town centre with retail outlets and there are plans for 1,500 new residents for the area within two decades.
Premier Jay Weatherill says the site will have wetlands to capture water for reuse.
The Government says a plan to create 6,300 jobs over two decades through $1 billion of private investment has been independently assessed.
Mr Weatherill said of the money to be put in by the State Government the net investment would amount to $77 million, because of the offset from land sales and rental income.
"That is a great return for our investment and, crucially, it's about ensuring that there is a future for jobs in the south of our state," he said.
The Premier said the site would become home to TAFE facilities and advanced manufacturing.
He said one company, Tier 5, planned to invest $113 million to set up a data centre.
The Opposition questioned last year whether TAFE had been given the prime part of a site which the Government had pledged would continue to be used for manufacturing.
Mitsubishi closed its Adelaide factory in 2008, leaving a site of more than 60 hectares.
