BLUE Sky Alternative Investments falling into administration will have “no effect” on the South Australian Government’s $50 million Venture Capital Fund, the former’s receivers say.
The Advertiser also understands the fund is on the verge of making its third investment, after previously putting money into SA companies Kid Sense and Myriota.
The State Government told The Advertiser last week that BSVC Pty Ltd – the manager of the SA VC Fund (SAVCF) – - “has evaluated over 350 potential investment opportunities since the launch of the fund and is in various stages of due diligence with 17 opportunities. The team also continues to be actively involved in Myriota and Kid Sense, the first two investments from the fund”.
KordaMentha told The Advertiser yesterday that not all parts of Blue Sky were in receivership and administration, and BSVC Pty Ltd, which is the fund’s manager, was not affected.
“In response to your inquiry about the SA Fund, there will be no effect,’’ a spokesman said.
“The manager of the fund is not in external administration and will continue operating under the existing structure.” The State Government contract with BSVC has a number of clauses that relate to adverse events and change of control which could allow the contract to be broken. The Government has not indicated it wants to go down such a path, and Treasurer Rob Lucas, pictured, said yesterday: “Any issues pertaining to the management of the SA Venture Capital Fund are an issue for its independent management committee, chaired by respected businessman Raymond Spencer.” Jason Neave, one of the organisers of the SouthStart start-up and entrepreneur conference held in Adelaide, said it was important that sources of funding such as the SAVCF were maintained, as there were already few local funding sources for emerging companies.PAGE 25: BUSINESS DAILY
