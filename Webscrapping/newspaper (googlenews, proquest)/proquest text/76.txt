IT is realistic to expect hundreds of young South Australians will find jobs in the space industry, the head of a new Space Academy says.
“The sector is growing massively,” assistant principal at Hamilton Secondary College and Academy head Sarah Baker said.
An Andy Thomas Space Foundation forum next month has attracted more than 70 businesses.
“We’ll get students there to talk directly to businesses about careers and pathways,” Dr Baker said.
“We’ve already had students who have internships and it’s highly likely they’ll get jobs.” SA companies at the forum include Fleet, Inovor, Redarc and Southern Launch. Government and academic institutions include the Adelaide-based Australian Space Agency and Smartsat Co-operative Research Centre.
The Space Academy has been opened by Hamilton Secondary this year, building on the space school operated by the college since 2018.
The Academy is a special interest course open for applications from students statewide.
It will teach coding, robotics, space botany and nutrition and other space-related topics.
The college also has opened its own planetarium, run by a teacher with an astrophysics background.
“We’ll start with our year 11s and the space Academy, then later this year it’ll be open for students from other schools,” Dr Baker said.
Hamilton Year 9 student Oliver Mawby-Wilkinson hopes to become a software engineer.
“There should be more money invested in specialist maths teachers in primary schools,” he said. Year 8’s Upsana Shrestha and Jasmine Atkinson wanted scientists to explore the dark side of the moon.
