PORT Adelaide Magpies rode the success of two one-run victories over Sturt Saints to qualify for the division one baseball finals, with 5-4 and 1-0 wins, the second an 11-inning thriller.
But the Saints still made the finals after Southern Districts Hawks dropped their first game 4-2 to Henley & Grange, after the Rams scored three runs in the final inning, with a 6-1 win in the second contest not good enough to earn a place in the top six.
At the top of the table, Kensington Cardinals made sure of the minor premiership with twin wins over East Torrens, 10-0 and 7-2. Golden Grove Central Districts qualified for second spot with double-header success over Woodville, winning game one 6-2 then backing up with an 8-6 victory, although it took 11 innings.
Although splitting the double-header with West Torrens, Glenelg clung on to third spot.
Goodwood Indians had two 11-1 wins over Adelaide Angels to make sure of a finals berth, Ben Wigmore belting two home runs, including a grand slam, in the second contest.
