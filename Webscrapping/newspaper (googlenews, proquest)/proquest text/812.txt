ADELAIDE’S start-up convention SouthStart is on this week, with about 1000 of the best and brightest entrepreneurs, investors, innovators, and students gather in our city.
On Thursday evening, Peel St, in the West End, will host a street party from 5pm-10pm, with local bars and restaurants taking part.
Entertainment will be provided by powerhouse DJ duo DJ Shep and Paul Bartlett, pictured, from left. DJ Shep has toured with the Hilltop Hoods, and Paul is currently the touring drummer for AB Original, but has had a 20-year career playing, writing, and producing music, as well as touring with the likes of Alicia Keys, John Legend, Christina Aguilera, and Lionel Richie.
“Paul and I got together through our love of pushing the limits of what is traditionally expected from DJs and drummers alike,” says DJ Shep.
“Our latest vision is inspired by wanting to create a new sound and experience to what is traditionally know as DJing.
“Paul’s ability to adapt on the fly has made him the perfect partner for my music sets. As I fire off track after track, his musical skill and beast-mode ability starts to shine.“His second drumming layer to the music gives the listener an experience that can only be achieved through live music.”
