FIVE South Australian companies are in the running to become the first to benefit from the State Government’s $50 million venture capital fund.
“We are currently doing due diligence on some SA-based opportunities and hope to make our first investment in the next three months,” Blue Sky Venture Capital boss Elaine Stead told The Advertiser yesterday.
Dr Stead declined to name the five contenders, which she said came from the local telecommunications, healthcare and agriculture industries.
They were selected from more than 100 companies that want a share of the 15-year funding pool, she said.
In May this year, The Advertiser revealed Blue Sky was the frontrunner to manage the SA Venture Capital Fund (SAVCF). Two months later the Brisbane-based firm was confirmed as manager.
The SAVCF has a mandate to invest in local early-stage companies with high growth potential from the late seed/Series A stage (early commercialisation) and ideally have a product to market, subject to other criteria.
Innovation Minister Kyam Maher said that the fund’s Government-appointed “management committee” comprises Economic Development Board chair Raymond Spencer, Alistair McCreadie, Don Caldwell, Judith Smith, and Donny Walford.
All positions are paid and for an initial three-year term.Only Ms Walford doesn’t sit on the fund’s tender evaluation panel, while Andrew Dunbar and Heather Watts have been appointed as “government observers” to the management committee.
