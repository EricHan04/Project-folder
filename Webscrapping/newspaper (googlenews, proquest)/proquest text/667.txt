ADELAIDE medical technology firm Signostics has roped in global giant Thermo Fisher Scientific to distribute its new handheld ultrasound device into the Australia and New Zealand markets.
The agreement with the New York Stock Exchange-listed major will result in a sales boost for the Signos RT, given the volume milestones tied into the deal, Signostics chief executive Warren Ortmann said.
"They need to sell at certain levels to keep their exclusivity and their reach and reputation will ensure that happens. It's great news for us," he said.
The Signos RT, launched in February, is said to be attracting widespread interest from medical practitioners, healthcare professionals and veterinarians globally.
"We are very excited about selling this truly portable and flexible point-of-care imaging tool and incorporating it into our existing product portfolio," Thermo Fisher Scientific's healthcare general manager Jarrod Percy said.
"Signostics has developed a revolutionary product which we believe will have a significant impact across our domestic Australian and NZ market."
Signostics this year signed an agreement with Konica Minolta Medical & Graphic for Signos RTs to be sold under Konica's brand, Sonimage P3. Konica will promote and sell the devices in both the human and veterinary markets in Japan, the US, China and India.
The electronic "brains" of the unit, which makes up 60 per cent of its cost, is made in SA by Ellex for Signostics; the box, probe and imaging screen are supplied by a Victorian company.
