MORE than 500 secondary students who have participated in Concept2Creation projects this year attended its expo recently.
The students, who came from 26 schools, presented a range of science, technology, engineering and mathematics projects to government, industry, education and community representatives.
The projects included developing a watering collection and sampling vehicle for use on suburban wetlands, constructing and flying a mission with an unmanned aerial vehicle, and developing an efficient, electric motor vehicle.
The event was also attended by C2C patron Governor Kevin Scarce.
