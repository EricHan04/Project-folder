MORE than 1100 space experts will descend on Adelaide today for the 11th Australian Space Forum.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison will open the forum, which will be hosted by the philanthropic and educational Andy Thomas Space Foundation (ATSF).
Foundation chairman Michael Davis said the forum would be the biggest ever gathering of the Australian space industry.
There will be more than 30 national and international speakers, including the new head of the Australian Space Agency, Enrico Palermo, and representatives of major aerospace companies Foundation CEO Professor Nicola Sasanelli said the forum would mark the launch of a $150,000 scholarship pool for educational initiatives this year.
There are $10,000 grants for postgraduate research in advanced satellite engineering and communications, $15,000 for undergraduates, and $10,000 grants for students seeking honours or masters degrees in space-related subjects.
Even schoolchildren are eligible for grants of up $5000 for space projects. Also on offer are internships with space companies with a value of $6000 each. Prof Sasanelli said the key to developing SA’s space industry was supporting and encouraging students.
“The success of the forum is due to the broad range of expertise mixed with young people learning about space and meeting the professionals,” she said of the twice-yearly event.
A feature of this year’s program will be a video message from NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, who is on the International Space Station.
There will also be a message from her husband, former NASA astronaut and ATSF patron Andy Thomas.
Today’s forum will run from 8.30am until 5pm at the Adelaide Convention Centre. Adelaide will also benefit from a new Space Discovery Centre at the city’s Lot Fourteen site. It will open to the public in May and include a Mission Control Centre and interactive space exhibits.
