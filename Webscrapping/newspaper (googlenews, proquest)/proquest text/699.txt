SOUTH Australia's bioscience industry has increased by 28 per cent over the past six years, a growth rate almost twice the national rate, Premier Mike Rann said yesterday.
"We've doubled the number of bioscience companies to more than 100, with employment in the industry growing by more than 10 per cent per annum over the past four years," he said. "Bioscience now employs more than 1200 people in our state and attracted more than $50 million in new investment last year alone."
Mr Rann was speaking as he officially opened the BioSA Incubator, the largest purpose-built facility of its kind in Australia. The Thebarton facility, which is guided by Bio Innovation SA, cost $12.9 million and has opened fully tenanted with six research and development companies.
The incubator would encourage small businesses to "cross-fertilise" and promote mentoring from more mature industry players in the broader Thebarton precinct.
Former thinker in residence Maire Smith, who suggested the incubator, was thrilled to see it become a reality. "It represents a step into the 21st century for industry," Dr Smith said.
One of the first tenants is the research arm of Mt Barker cosmetics company Jurlique. "We want to engage with the state's academic landscape and use collaboration to advance our products," Jurlique R&D vice-president Florian Wolf said.
Bio Innovation SA chairman Dennis Mutton said related developments were expected on vacant blocks adjacent to the incubator.
