STEWART Bartlett can work overseas and long hours in his role as quality and regulatory manager at medical device company Signostics.
So he takes time out every Thursday morning to read with his daughter, Rosie, during her Year 2 lesson at Adelaide's Walford Anglican School for Girls.
It gives him regular bonding time with his daughter and helps her with her learning.
"Our workplace is a flexible workplace. We are a relatively small company and we deal internationally so it's not uncommon for me to go overseas travelling or be away or work late and nights because of the time zones," he says.
"There's never a question of `you're 30 minutes late, you have to work 30 minutes later' because the demands of the job are quite high.
"It's give and take the expectation goes both ways."
Head of Junior School Rainer Mayer says it is encouraging to see the number of dads who are rearranging work and commitments to take their daughters to school and spend quality time with them in class.
"Once a conspicuous absence, the number of dads coming into the classrooms has risen in recent times and the trend is to be welcomed," he says.
"It is quite common to walk into a junior primary class in the morning and see a significant number of adults listening to the teacher as she shares some new learning or helping a student find a reader and listening to them."
School principal Rebecca Clarke says the teachers are as keen as the students to have parents involved in their child's learning.
