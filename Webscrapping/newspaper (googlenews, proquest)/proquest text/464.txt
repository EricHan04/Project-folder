PAKISTAN'S hopes of gaining much-needed batting practice ahead of next week's first Test were trampled yesterday by a pair of rookie fast bowlers.
The tourists staggered to 7/204 at tea on the first day of their four-day tour game against Western Australia at the WACA Ground.
The chief destroyers for WA were pacemen Brett Dorey and Ben Edmondson - who entered the match with just eight first-class games between them.
Dorey bagged each of the first three wickets to fall, including the prized scalp of Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq for four.
Edmondson was equally impressive and was on a hat-trick after removing Salman Butt (61) and Shoaib Malik (0) with successive balls.
Malik, who entered the match under an injury cloud after hurting his wrist playing table soccer, fell to a superb diving catch by wicket-keeper Ryan Campbell in front of first slip.
After slipping to 5/78, the tourists steadies after lunch, courtesy of a 95-run stand between vice captain Yousuf Youhana and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq.
Youhana looked at ease on the fast-paced track and was particularly strong square of the wicket before being caught in the gully off the bowling of Steve Magoffin for 77.
Magoffin struck again in the same over when wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal edged to Mike Hussey at second slip for a duck. Razzaq remained unbeaten on 25.
