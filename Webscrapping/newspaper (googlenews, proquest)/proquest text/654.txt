SOUTH Australian medical devices firm Signostics is in talks with potential overseas partners to grab a larger slice of the healthcare market.
The company has appointed a consultant in the US to help it to go from being a one-product entity to becoming an original equipment manufacturer. The potential partner will have established brands and distribution channels to assist Signostics in commercialising its research and development pipeline and grow.
"For a small company like Signostics, we really have two choices - we either create our own international distribution channels, build our own brand, which can be very expensive, or we can look at partnering with companies that already have that," chief executive Neil Bartlett said.
Any merger or acquisition talks were excluded from the discussions, he said. " (We are) Purely looking at OEM (original equipment manufacturer) strategic partnerships manufacturing - we'll manufacture under their brand name potentially and supply product to them," he said.
"We are looking to achieve that sometime in 2011. There are a number of partners that are very interested but it's early days yet," Mr Bartlett said.
Signostics, which was formed in 2005 by co-founders and brothers Neil and Stewart Bartlett, is in the midst of commercialising its hand-held ultrasound device Signos in the US and Europe.
It expanded into the US in 2008 and aims to develop fast and affordable point-of-care medical devices.
Next year, the company will raise up to $5 million from existing investors and venture capital partners for product development and marketing Signos.
So far, it has raised about $19 million and has gained regulatory ap-
provals to enter the human medical device market for the US, Europe,
and Australia.
