PAKISTAN off-spinner Shoaib Malik faces an uncertain future after hi-tech testing on his suspect action in Perth yesterday.
But he is likely to be free to play in the three-Test series against Australia at the WACA Ground from Thursday.
The allrounder yesterday had his action filmed and scrutinised by a team of biomechanics at the University of WA.
They are the same panel of experts who worked with accused chuckers Shoaib Akhtar (Pakistan) and Muttiah Muralitharan (Sri Lanka).
The Pakistan Cricket Board commissioned the tests after Malik was reported for bowling with a suspect action in a one-day tournament in October. The UWA's professor Bruce Elliott said the combination of electronic sensors and 12 cameras operating at 250 frames per second ensured hole-proof accuracy.
"This is absolute state-of-the-art," Elliott said. "You don't get any better anywhere in the world."
Elliott said the results of the tests would be known by the end of the week and a report sent to the Pakistan Cricket Board.
The PCB will forward the findings to the International Cricket Council which, if satisfied Malik's flaws have been remedied, will take no further action. If Malik, 22, is reported again he may be suspended.
