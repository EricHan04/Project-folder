EMERGING and established South Australian companies are reaching out for the expanded support offered by Tech Hub, a bioscience facility set up within the Thebarton technology precinct.
Geneworks, Ellex Precise, CPR Pharma, and Austofix will lease space within Tech Hub as tenants of BioSA, a state government agency, which is leasing the building from a Melbourne-based private investor.
Austofix chairman Mark Balnaves said the company had secured additional business, which had prompted the move, but will continue to maintain some presence at its North Plympton offices.
Some of the companies are graduating from the nearby BioSA business incubator. BioSA chief executive Dr Jurgen Michaelis said bringing world-class health and medical technology companies together and offering them support to grow was exciting.
"It's about creating the high-skilled jobs for the growth of the economy," he said. "Our Tech Hub facility ... is already at 90 per cent occupancy." The Tech Hub, announced in January last year by Minister for Science and Information Economy Grace Portolesi will have a pilot manufacturing suite, larger lab sizes and additional office space that are better able to accommodate companies who are expanding beyond early stage.
The announcement of the new facility's tenancies comes as BioSA moves to expand its presence at Thebarton, after moving out of its King William Street premises. It will move into space emptied by handheld ultrasound manufacturer Signostics, which will make Tonsley Park its home."We are providing companies with state-of-the-art laboratory and production space that would normally be beyond their financial capacity, allowing them to direct their finances to accelerate their products and services to markets such as pharmaceuticals, clinical services and medical devices," Dr Michaelis said.
