Maddison Caitlin Susan Fisher & Luke Ashley Short Married at The Barns of Freeling
ALMOST five years ago, Luke and Maddison shared one of the most important moments of their lives together when Maddison gave birth to their first child, Paityn.
Luke decided it was time to solidify his perfect family. He took Maddison shopping for her birthday and, very subtly, led her to the jewellery shops. There, they picked out her engagement ring.
On their big day, a horse and cart from Classic Carriage Drives picked up the bride and bridesmaids from the couple’s Freeling home, then drove through the town to The Barns of Freeling.
Their children Paityn Grace Short, 4, and Hamish Theodore Short, 2, pictured right, kicked off the ceremony as the flower girl and page boy. The couple then promised a lifetime together before their celebrant Natasha Winter and 80 loved ones.
The wedding had plenty of DIY touches, with help from Venyu – hidden and unique wedding venues – and The Barns. “We could not fault the entire day at all,” Maddison says. “Everything ran so smoothly and we are over the moon with the amount of love and support we have from family and friends.” The bride wore a lace dress from ASOS, a custom veil by Dressmaking Boutique by Kasia Litwinienko, with bouquets by long-term school friend Bonnie Balogh, owner of A Peony For Your Thoughts.
Maid of honour Nicole Burns and bridesmaids Jacqui Kotal and Jamie Lee Montgomery wore Shona Joy champagne dresses. Best man was Matt Jackson, and Ben Macey and Ben Stephens were groomsmen.
The couple met through work at Drakes Supermarkets in 2013.
Maddison is the daughter of Les Fisher, of Lyndoch, and the late Lorene Fisher. Luke is the son of Peter and Cheryl Short, of Paralowie.
