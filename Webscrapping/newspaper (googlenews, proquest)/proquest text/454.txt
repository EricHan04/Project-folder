FORMER Australian captain Kim Hughes has called on the selectors to drop Darren Lehmann for Simon Katich.
His comments come after South Australian Lehmann made his second failure of the WACA Test yesterday, falling to the bowling of Danish Kaneria for five.
It followed his first-innings 12, when awkward footwork left his stumps exposed to a Shoaib Akhtar thunderbolt.
In his past six Tests, Lehmann, 34, has scored 238 at an average of 26.44.
"It might sound like a big call but I think it's time to bite the bullet," Hughes said on ABC radio.
"It's time to bring Simon Katich in because when you get to 34, pace starts to worry you. (Lehmann's) time has come and they need to make the change."
Katich, 29, was controversially dropped after Australia's tour of India in October-November when he finished third in the team's batting averages with 276 runs at 39.43. He has scored 78 and 30 in his only first-class appearances for NSW this summer.
Lehmann appears certain to get the final two Tests against Pakistan, but he would need to assert himself to ensure he holds off the challenge of Katich for the three-Test tour of New Zealand in February-March.
Lehmann, recently judged Wisden Australia Cricketer of the Year, has stated his goal to make his first and last Ashes tour next year. Though Lehmann scored 81 in the second Test against New Zealand in Adelaide, the manner of his dismissals in Perth would not have impressed the national selectors.
With the Boxing Day Test coming up at the MCG, things are looking grim.
In his only Test there, against England in 1998, he made a 13 and a 4 to leave his MCG Test average at a modest 8.5 runs.
