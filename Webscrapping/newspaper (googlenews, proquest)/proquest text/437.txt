EIGHT South Australian start-ups have made it through to the next round of an entrepreneurship competition founded by the Duke of York.
Prince Andrew joined judges in Adelaide yesterday, continuing his support of en-trepreneurs across the world through the Pitch@Palace program he established in 2014.
A total of 13 South Australian entrepreneurs pitched their ideas at the event, hosted by UniSA, in a bid for a place at a national boot camp and pitch competition in Brisbane on Friday.
Sports analytics venture Athlete’s AI, 3D printing education start-up Makers Empire, and Alzheimer’s disease detection company Tiantai Medical Technology were among those selected to take part in the next stage.
Speaking at the event, Prince Andrew praised the entrepreneurs, who each had three minutes to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges.“I am a strong believer that when it comes to entrepreneurs it is about how we can all work together to ensure these businesses have the best opportunities,” said the Duke, who leaves Adelaide this morning.
