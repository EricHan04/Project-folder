A SERVICE that offers consumers an itemised energy cost report will make it easier to monitor and control usage, says system integrator AZZO Automation.
AZZO's innovative service involves clamping portable meters on power supply lines to monitor energy usage by each appliance or area over a certain period.
Real-time energy consumption data is then sent back via satellite to an online energy management system.
The web-hosted service allows customers to turn metered usage and other data into actionable information. AZZO is a finalist in the CleverGreen Innovators to Watch service awards.
AZZO offers electrical engineering, energy solutions integration as well as electrical contracting services.
"We work in partnership with our clients to deliver innovative and practical solutions," AZZO business development manager James DiLiberto said.
Winners of the CleverGreen Innovators to Watch awards, backed by The Advertiser, will be announced at the CleverGreen conference in Adelaide next month.
