SOUTH Australia is expected to hold further talks with one of the world's leading entrepreneurs as they develop plans to build a huge battery farm to address an energy crisis.
Billionaire Elon Musk has flagged that his US-based company, Tesla, could build a 100 megawatt hour battery farm for $33 million in less than four months after gaining approval.
Such a system could help the state avoid a repeat of recent blackouts due to load-shedding.
Mr Musk revealed via Twitter yesterday that he had spoken by phone with Premier Jay Weatherill, with whom he was "very impressed".
Mr Weatherill later confirmed he had "positive discussions" with Mr Musk "regarding his battery proposal" in a call which is understood to have lasted about 20 minutes.
They are expected to speak again in coming days.
The Government has faced criticism for delays in releasing its energy plan, but Mr Weatherill yesterday said it would be made public "very soon".
According to figures quoted by Mr Musk, the SA system would cost $33.2 million. Shipping, taxes and installation costs would be extra.
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the Tesla proposal was a "game changer" for South Australia.
"While chairing a senate inquiry into battery storage, I've heard evidence that if 20,000 homes with solar panels had a battery as well, the load shedding that cut off the airconditioning when we needed it most last month wouldn't have happened."Business leaders such as Australian Telstra Business Woman of the Year and Suntrix Solar founder Jenny Paradiso, the tech community including Startup Adelaide and SouthStart director Steve Barrett, accounting firm Accodex's Michael Macolino have thrown their support behind the proposal.
