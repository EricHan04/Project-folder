Gawler Rangers Baseball Club survived relegation to division four and has recruited well to solidify its position in the state league competition for 2013/14.
The club has signed American import Jarvis Beck as division three coach, who also will mentor the under 17 side ' the first time the club has had a team in this grade.
Beck is looking forward to the challenge of helping develop a young club, and said he is keen to turn around the Rangers fortunes, after a win-less season in 2012/13.
Besides the baseball smarts of Beck behind the plate as the main catcher, Gawler also has recruited former Adelaide Angels division one pitcher Clayton Neaylon, who is keen to help some of the 'young guns' at the club develop as pitchers.
Local member for Parliament John Dawkins, who also helped start the Gawler & District Softball Association, has come on board as a club patron, and last Saturday threw out the ceremonial first pitch to start the new season.
There will be an adjustment period for the A grade side, with a new look line-up, which includes Liam Holland returning from injury and veteran Dave O'Brien to anchor the infield at first base.
A trio of young players who came through the club's junior program, Dylan Winning, Steve Van Poorten and Adam Soar, are establishing themselves in the senior team, while promising juniors Zac Allen and Thomas Norley are in the wings.
Veteran Paul Skelton and second-year player Alex Skewes offer flexibility, while a number of under 17 players could see action in the A grade this season.
The club has three senior teams, in divisions three, five and seven, and four junior sides, in under 17s, under 15s and two Little League teams.
There is also Tee-ball and Rookie-ball competitions, at the club's home ground at Karbeethan Reserve, Evanston Gardens. For any information on Gawler Rangers, contact Rob on 0407 979 163.
