FOUR South Australian businesses are to share more than $1.2 million through a State Government commercialisation fund intended to leverage more money in private sector capital contributions.
The early stage ventures TCPinpoint, Climate Change Technologies, Cryoclock and Safe Ag Systems will all be given State Government support for their innovations via the Commercialisation and Start-up Fund (RCSF). “These four local companies have been supported to grow their innovative businesses, solving challenges through technology in agriculture, property, energy, radar and communications,” Minister for Innovation and Skills David Pisoni said.
TCPinpoint will receive $100,000 to commercialise its project management software tool for building retail tenancies in shopping centres while Climate Change Technologies gets $582,000 to support its thermal energy storage device, an alternative to conventional batteries, to provide a cost effective and environmentally safe renewable energy system.
Safe Ag Systems will receive $500,000 for a platform that helps farmers comply with workplace health and safety training and reporting requirements without compromising productivity. Cryoclock will be given $100,000 to fund further product development of its ultra-precise clock, which is improving the accuracy of high-performance computing, telecommunications, radar and radio astronomy systems in the scientific defence industry and industrial markets.
“The RCSF is building research and development capability within SA and helping entrepreneurs bring their ideas to global markets,” Minister Pisoni said. Building a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem and supporting SA entrepreneurs looking to start or scale their businesses is pivotal to government policy he said.
Cryoclock managing director, professor Andre Luiten plans to tailor his ultraprecise clock to suit communications and non-defence purposes and open up new markets.“Next generation communications, computing and radar systems are critically dependent upon access to incredibly good timing,” he said.
