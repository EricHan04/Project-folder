OLDER Australians are adopting telehealth and many will continue to access medical care by phone or internet after the pandemic, Adelaide research has shown.
Yesterday the Global Centre for Modern Ageing at Tonsley, released its report Telehealth – Here To Stay?
The report includes the results of an online survey of 1200 Australians that revealed 67 per cent of those aged over 60 who used telehealth in the pandemic said they would feel confident using it in the future.
But just under half (49 per cent) said they were “likely” to. Chief executive Julianne Parkinson says the study will help inform industry and government about older people’s experiences of telehealth. “We can see what has worked well with telehealth – and have also uncovered some of the challenges,” she said.
