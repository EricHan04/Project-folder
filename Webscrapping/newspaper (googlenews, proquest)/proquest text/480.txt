PAKISTAN is staring at another embar rassing outright de feat after a venomless bowling display against Western Australia at the WACA Ground yesterday.
After making 262 in its first innings, Pakistan could only look on as WA recovered from 3/84 to 9(dec)/404 on the second day of the four-day match. Despite having been in Perth for 12 days, Pakistan is running out of time to find form before the first Test against Australia from Thursday. Already the tourists have lost to WA's Second XI in their opening tour match before an unconvincing victory against the Cricket Australia Chairman's XI at Lilac Hill.
WA vice-captain Mike Hussey reminded Australian selectors of his worth yesterday with 124, while fellow Australia A batsman Marcus North made 79. The pair shared a 148-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Pacemen Shoaib Akhtar (2/41) and Mohammad Sami (1/104) were disappointing.
