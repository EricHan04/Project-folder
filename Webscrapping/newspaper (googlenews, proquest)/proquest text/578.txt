ADELAIDE-BASED franchise group Ready Steady Go Kids is opening for business in the UK next year after a deal was sealed this month.
UK-based couple Kathy and Matthew Bees have bought into the international franchise started in Adelaide after finding the company that specialises in running multi-sport programs for preschoolers online.
"We were looking for the right business opportunity," the UK-based couple said.
They now planned to open locations in the south of England in January 2013 with plans to franchise the business there nationally within the next 18 to 24 months.
The news follows the company's expansion into Singapore earlier this year, with Ready Steady Go Kids owners, husband and wife team Stuart and Toni Derbyshire, seeing the business double in size after they took it on last year. It is also now operating in 70 Australian locations.
Mr Derbyshire believed the Ready Steady Go Kids name would eventually win recognition around the globe.
"This opens up a fantastic opportunity for Ready Steady Go Kids to not only maintain its position as the largest multi-sport exercise program in Australia but also to fulfil similar roles around the globe," he said.
The company has also added 10 new Australian franchises to its network starting in Term 1 next year.
