DUAL Norm Smith medallist Andrew McLeod has told how he and tennis star Lleyton Hewitt filmed a documentary in Darwin and planned to release a DVD in coming months.
The documentary, filmed during a two-week period, is centred on McLeod showing the former tennis world No. 1 his upbringing in the Top End.
"It was about me showing him where I grew up and the beauty of the Northern Territory," the Adelaide midfielder said.
"(Hewitt's) never been out bush before so it was a bit of an experience for him.
"He's on the circuit all the time so it's pretty hard for him to do things like that. It was a great opportunity for him to see it."
McLeod wrote the script for the documentary himself and hired a camera crew to do the filming.
It's the first step in a broader plan to move into TV when his football days finish.
"I'd like do something in the media, like The Great Outdoors or something along those lines," McLeod said.
"I enjoy the lifestyle programs. I've done a little bit of that before and I want to go into that."
McLeod, who declined to talk about Hewitt's break-up with Kim Clijsters, is looking forward to watching hie mate during the Australian Open in January.
For now, McLeod is focusing on pre-season training with the Crows.
The 28-year-old is itching to resume under the coaching of Neil Craig, who replaced Gary Ayres late last season.
"It's been pretty amazing," McLeod said.
"Everything's totally fresh. There's certainly a good vibe and a good feel about it."
