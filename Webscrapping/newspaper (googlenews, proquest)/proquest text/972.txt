DON'T MISS
ROCKWIZ
SBS, 8.30PM
WHAT do Tex Perkins' parents call him?
Darling, apparently. Yes, Tex makes a return to the 'Wiz tonight. Watch just to hear him sing the best bit of the Rolling Stones' Emotional Rescue.
There is also a really good story by another guest, Mia Dyson, who went to the US and hooked up with a manager (Eurythmics' Dave Stewart actually) who tried to make her an androgynous act called Boy.
RAGE
ABC, 10.30AM/11.20PM
THIS could be interesting. Or not. Rage has given in to election fever and this morning and tonight it's not rock stars choosing their favourite videos, but politicians. There's Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Deputy Leader of the Opposition Julie Bishop and Deputy Leader of the Greens Adam Bandt, all getting some time on the couch. Will Bishop dust off her trademark death stare?
FOXTEL
ONE DIRECTION: ONLY WAY IS UP
CHANNEL [V], 5PM
ANYONE after an unauthorised One Direction documentary?
This one was made in the US and goes through each member of the boy band to tell you why they're popular. Harry Styles is the "lovable rogue" who was shattered after his parents' divorce when he was a child. And Sinitta, who worked on the show, said Harry was excited that becoming a pop star meant he was going to get lots of girlfriends. Yes, it's that kind of show.
