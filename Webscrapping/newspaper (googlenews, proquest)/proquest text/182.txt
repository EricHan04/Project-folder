ALLISON Nikula started her health technology business with $3.50 and an idea inspired by her grandparents – it is now a prime example of how technology can benefit families.
An occupational therapist, she found her grandparents getting to an age where they needed support. The family wanted to contribute to theircare but found communication wasfragmented. This gave her the idea for CareApp, linking families with their loved ones in care, and their carers.
“It started with a $3.50 cappuccino and a few sketches on a piece of paper, talking with a care worker and asking, ‘What do you think?’,” she said.
“Every day, I still speak with our users, whether that be family members, disability support workers, lifestyle co-ordinators and the decision makers.” Connecting all involved in an aged-care setting may require the person in care to be schooled in technology but Ms Nikula says there are “people aged 85-plus” using CareApp. “We are working hand-in-hand with users – we should not underestimate people’s skills,” she told the forum. “It’s about holding their hand and bringing them along for the ride.” Ms Nikula and other speakers, such as orthopaedic surgeon Dr Matthew Liptak, stressed the importance of putting both patients and clinicians at the centre of developing new health technology, rather than having it presented to them and being told to use it.
Dr Liptak recalled “swearing at my screen” in frustration at the controversial electronic patient record system (EPAS) which blew out in time and cost and was partly abandoned midway through introduction.
The forum also heard many wrist-worn monitoring devices and health apps were not approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as medical devices. Dr Liptak said this meant clinicians could not use the information as accurate evidence of past health situations.
Professor Trish Williams is working on an international standard for such devices.
