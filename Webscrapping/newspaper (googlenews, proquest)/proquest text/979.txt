IT WILL come as news to no one that Darwin and Palmerston's real estate markets are booming.
But economic development is also fuelling growth in some less- likely places.
Director of KG Young and Associates Tony Pickering says Batchelor's real estate market is surging thanks to the new Compass mine, slated to open later this year, and the town's proximity to Darwin.
"There is a lot of interest in buying there as an investment," Mr Pickering said.
"We sold a few for the NT Government recently and one was bought purely to be rented to the mine."
The large-scale retirement of the baby boomers is also fuelling demand and the combined forces are having an impact on prices.
"A year ago $80,000 might have bought a three-bedroom house," Mr Pickering said. "Buyers now have to find over $100,000."
And it's not just Batchelor benefiting.
"Other areas like Adelaide River might move a bit as well because it's not a long drive to the mine from there," he said.
