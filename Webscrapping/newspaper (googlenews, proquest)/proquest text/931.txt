An Investigator College Goolwa student was one of eight lucky students to participate in the inaugural Adelaide Central School of Art summer art camp in Adelaide form January 16 to 19.
Seraphina Grace-Marshall took part in the program, which aims to give regional South Australian teenagers a taste of life at art school. She enjoyed the drawing and painting workshops.
"Being able to visit galleries and museums with kids my age and talking about art was so refreshing. I have made an amazing group of friends that come from all over the state and love art as much as I do. It has helped shape some of my pieces I hope to do in my senior art class at school," she said.
Materials, meals, accommodation, and travel subsidies are provided by the School, with help from Burnside Village Foundation.
