UP-and-coming South Australian entrepreneurs may be unaware that their business has global reach, according to the co-director of the SouthStart conference.
Steve Barrett, who co-founded office management software company Teamgo alongside fellow SouthStart director Chhai Thach, said the modern business landscape was one of "no barriers, no borders", particularly for those in the tech-related industries.
"It's not hard to pick up the phone or to connect online with people who are in far-flung places around the world," Mr Barrett told The Advertiser in the lead-up to the fourth staging of SouthStart next week.
"There's a world of possibilities at the tip of our fingers." This year's conference, which will be over two days as part of Entrepreneurs Week, is themed "Going Global".
"It's about educating businesses about going to the next level, a 'whole of the world' approach," Mr Barrett said.
"SA punches well above its weight in the global market based on our population size." More than 20 SouthStart speakers will address an expected 500-plus delegates. They include Samuel Conway from tech start-up Zegami, Myriota boss Alex Grant, Che Metcalfe from Uniti Wireless, and Teamgage director Noelle Smit.
"In the last 12 months, we've more than doubled our revenue and grown from three to nine staff. Our plan is to go global, but keep our headquarters in Adelaide," Ms Smit said.
"In the past four years, I think we've seen Adelaide's start-up ecosystem mature a lot with an explosion of programs, accelerators and innovation centres all catering for different stage start-ups." SouthStart is in the fourth and final year of a funding agreement with the State Government. As yet, that funding has not been renewed, although it is hoped Premier Jay Weatherill will make an announcement when he speaks at the event.
The Advertiser also understands that Mr Weatherill will announce BlueSky as fund manager for the State Government's $50 million venture capital fund during Entrepreneurs Week. Mr Weatherill is scheduled to speak at midday on day two of SouthStart, with BlueSky's head of venture capital Elaine Stead taking to the stage later that day.
Neither the State Government or BlueSky would confirm if an announcement would be made on the day. The VC fund's co-investment model will see public money invested alongside private funds. Local early-stage companies will be the focus, while interstate operators who relocate to SA will also be eligible.
Innovation Minister Kyam Maher recently said the fund was on schedule to commence operation prior to July 1.
Announced in last year's State Budget, it was initially hoped to be running by January.
SouthStart has got the signatures of 130 industry leaders, business owners, and venture capitalists who support its idea of a State Government-funded, CBD-based tech precinct.
