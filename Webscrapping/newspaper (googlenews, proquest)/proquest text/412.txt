AN Adelaide company established by former Flinders University students and which created an avatar to help the aged-care and disabilities sectors was a double winner at this week's SA and Northern Territory iAwards.
Clevertar, a company of just six staff based in the CBD, was one of 15 state winners that will move forward to the national iAwards in Melbourne in August.
Clevertar's AnnaCares iPad app is an assistive technology solution that allows service providers to log in remotely and add medication reminders and appointments directly into a client's calendar - which is then updated instantly to their iPad.
The cloud-hosted service is designed to replace short care visits said Tanya Newhouse who collected the New Product and Health awards from Education and Child Development Minister Susan Close.
"We're not public focused yet, we're just dealing with service providers at present such as Helping Hands," said Ms Newhouse. She explained "Anna" was chosen as a generic and popular everyday name.
The app is simple to deal with and allows users at both ends to initiate instant messaging among numerous features.
Other winners at the Adelaide Convention Centre bash included the SA Country Fire Service, which picked up the Premier's Award for its work in combating the Samson Flat bushfire this year via its incident-management system, Crimson, which provided accurate and up-to-date information to the public - a key factor contributing to no loss of human life.
And a state Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure initiative to provide schoolchildren from reception to Year 7 with a $50 discount from sports club or membership fees, via an online portal picked up the SMS Management and Technology award.
