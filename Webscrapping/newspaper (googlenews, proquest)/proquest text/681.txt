TONSLEY-based, hand-held ultrasound manufacturer Signostics is using NanoConnect to help its improve its Signos RT product as well as lower costs.
Signostics co-founder Stewart Bartlett said research was focused on two areas -- use of different oils that touch the ultrasound's transducer (the part that transmits the ultrasound signals) so the images can be of better clarity and the use of nanostructures to make its soft rubber mould more resistant and durable.
"We contract manufacture our transducer, most expensive part of our hand-held device, in Adelaide (through Ellex Medical Lasers) with some materials being manufactured interstate and overseas.
"Any improvement in our product and costs is great for a company building export markets and being close to breaking even." Signostics has re-signed its original equipment manufacturer partnership with Japanese multinational Konica Minolta for the current financial year, in which Konica sells the product in Japan and the US, with China, India and South America to follow. The device is also approved for sale in Australia, Asia, Europe and Canada.
Interstate entrepreneurs have also latched on to the benefits of nanotech with Sydney-based, Swiss-made watch importer Bausele Australia investigating use of sturdier watch case materials and investigating luminescent material.
Bausele founder Christophe Hoppe's watches, retailing for $248 -- $1488, offer a unique proposition -- to carry a piece of Australia wherever you go whether it's beach sand, coal or red earth.Mr Hoppe hopes to use the research to build an Australian-made watches business around premium customised offerings.
