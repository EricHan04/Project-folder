ADELAIDE-based multi-sport exercise company Ready Steady Go Kids has opened its first international franchise in Singapore.
The deal has seen Singaporean businessman Wee Lee Chua launch the company's multi-sport program in eight childcare centres this month.
Mr Chua, who has previously worked in corporate roles with Adidas and other sports-related companies, has plans to have the programs operating in 50 childcare centres and 20 independent locations across Singapore. Many are expected to start by Term 1 next year.
"I want to help the nation build a sporting culture - it's one of the big things I love about Australia and Australians from my previous trips there," Mr Chua says.
"I am truly passionate about sport and believe it is a wonderful tool to bring people together, teach life lessons and unite people of different backgrounds."
The Adelaide-based Ready Steady Go Kids company, owned by husband and wife team Stuart and Toni Derbyshire, negotiated the deal as a "master franchise".
"(That is) where we sell them the rights to run the business nationally," Mr Derbyshire says.
Mr Derbyshire says the company has been negotiating with Mr Chua since September last year, with his Singapore-based team visiting Ready Steady Go Kids in Adelaide for a week to assess the business and see its programs in operation.
He and his team have since undergone two weeks intensive training with Mr and Mrs Derbyshire heading to Singapore to provide further training in August.
In the past year, the company has also undergone a rebrand, introduced a new website with online enrolments and opened at more than 30 new locations across Australia.
Ready Steady Go Kids is a physio-designed multi-sports program for children aged from two-and-a-half to six years.
It covers the fundamentals of 10 different sports while developing age-appropriate motor skills.
