SOUTH Australia recorded its second Claxton Shield win with a comfortable 8-4 dismissal of the Australian Provincial side in Sydney last night.
Leigh Chenoweth, Craig Watts and Dan Wilson all scored twice for SA, which appeared to have the game in its keeping after banking five runs in the first three innings.
Australian Provincial responded with four runs of its own in the fourth inning, but SA claimed the decisive break with three runs spread between innings five and six.
SA's win gives it a 2-1 record after its loss to Victoria and victory over New South Wales.
Its clash with Queensland, abandoned on Sunday due to rain, has been rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
In yesterday's early match, Queensland ground out a 2-0 win over Western Australia.
Meanwhile in last night's SA Baseball League round, Henley and Grange outlasted Woodville 8-7, West Torrens saw off Kensington 7- 3, Southern Districts starved Port Adelaide 2-0, and the Adelaide Angels accounted for the Goodwood Indians 6-4.
