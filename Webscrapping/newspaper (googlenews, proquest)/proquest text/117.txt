PORT Pirie-born designer Michael Azzollini’s love affair with swimwear was never going to be a brief encounter.
And budgie smugglers were all the rage at his men’s swimwear brand AZZO’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia showing.
It was arguably the most fun so far at the Sydney event with the crowd cheering before the show had even started on the wet runway.
And what a show it was, with a procession of bronzed, oil-slicked bodies parading Speedo-style briefs and low-slung shorts, right.
The designs were emblazoned with Michael’s original prints which included fruit, anchors, chains, paisley, flamingoes and candy.
It’s not the first time Michael been part of the MBFWA designer line-up. He and former business partner Kate Nichols showcased their sexy swimwear label Azzollini, which they co-designed for seven years until 2010, at the event.Kate was front row at the AZZO show along with a number of Michael’s friends including some drag queens who would have stolen the show at a less exciting event. Michael, who is also a stylist and has worked with big names like Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Hawkins and appeared on Australia’s Next Top Model, says he’s hoping the MBFWA exposure will take AZZO, which is already stocked by David Jones, to the next level.
