A $100 million data centre is planned for the former Mitsubishi site at Tonsley Park.
Adelaide IT entrepreneur Marty Gauvin plans to build the state's largest data centre on the site, and is in negotiations with the State Government over leasing a 4000sq/m plot.
Mr Gauvin, who founded and ran data-hosting company Hostworks until April last year, plans to build a data centre with 10 times the capacity of the Hostworks centre at Kidman Park.
Mr Gauvin said yesterday his new company, Tier 5, aimed to service the needs of large customers.
The centre would be scalable as customers' needs grew, with a cost for the first stage of $100 million dependent on demand.
The project would use a "pod-based" design that could be scaled up easily.
Mr Gauvin said Adelaide was an example of a city that risked being under-serviced in terms of data centre capacity. "We are very keen to do this in Adelaide in the first instance . . . we see it as an ideal example of what we would call secondary cities from a data centre perspective.
"Outside of the prime locations in the world where the marketplace is working, we see the opportunity to work cooperatively and have a facility which is flexible enough so it can actually move capacity around between facilities, and so reduce the risk of building something substantial.
"If you couldn't take this approach, a city like Adelaide could be one which misses out on the good data centres because no one's prepared to take the risk."
Mr Gauvin said Tier 5 would be a wholesale provider, aimed at servicing customers who need 1M of IT capacity or more.
These would broadly be telecommunications providers, outsourcers and service providers, corporations and government agencies, and companies looking to sell data capacity on a retail level.
