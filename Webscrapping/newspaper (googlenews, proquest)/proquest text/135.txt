WASHINGTON: First lady Laura Bush yesterday said the U.S. was ready to provide more aid to Burma to help its recovery from a devastating cyclone that killed more than 10,000 people.
But she said help was conditional on a U.S. disaster response team being allowed into the country.
Mrs Bush rebuked Burma's ruling junta on other fronts in a rare appearance at the White House press briefing room. She faulted the junta for proceeding with a May 10 constitutional referendum that she described as a sham and criticised government leaders for not warning about the storm.
