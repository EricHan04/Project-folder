THEY are keeping things in perspective at Fremantle. And not just in a football sense.
Forward Paul Medhurst yesterday revealed his sparkling final term against Richmond was inspired by the birth of his brother on Thursday.
"It was just the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen by that far," Medhurst said.
"I've got a little brother now, little William. To see it happen, it just puts things into a bit more perspective."
Medhurst emerged from a quiet first three quarters to light up the Dockers forward line late in the final term. But not before a verbal revving from coach Chris Connolly.
Medhurst admitted his telephone conversation with the coach had fired him into action in the final 10 minutes. He returned to kick two goals in a minute as the Dockers galloped to a match-winning four-goal lead.
"Chris just reinforced my role in the forward line," Medhurst said. "He took me off the ground because he wanted to talk to me one- on-one about what he wanted me to do in the last quarter.
"Thankfully, listening to him, I got a little bit of room and got a couple of goals away in the end."
The Dockers can secure a finals spot by overcoming the Kangaroos at the MCG on Sunday.
Medhurst said Saturday's victory had eased some of the enormous pressure on the club.
