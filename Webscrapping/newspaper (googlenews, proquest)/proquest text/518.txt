New Zealand's only international elite duathlete, Mark Bailey, had to settle for a close third in the Australian championship in Adelaide after losing a keen tactical battle. Bailey caught pace- setter David Evans early in the cycle leg and rode away from him at the 20km mark. "Unfortunately, working by myself expended most of my reserves and the fresher legs went past me on the second run," Bailey said. "I started to pick up the pace in the last 2km, but it was not enough." The 10km run, 40km bike ride, and 5km run was won by Australia's Craig McKenzie with Evans second. "I was reasonably happy with my performance. I raced strongly, but unfortunately lost the tactical battle." Bailey will now return to Christchurch to continue his preparations for the world championships at Atlanta in October.
