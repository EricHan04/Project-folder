JUSTIN Langer has weighed into the Shoaib Akhtar-Matthew Hayden verbal joust, claiming the Australian opener would win the on-field battle this summer.
Last week Shoaib declared Langer was a better batsman than Hayden and would pose a greater threat to Pakistan's bowlers.
Langer, who counts Hayden among his closest friends, warned Shoaib that his fellow opener would talk with his bat.
"It's a bit like a boxing match in that the silent fighter usually wins," Langer said. "We'll wait and see. I know who I'll be backing.
"I think I'll be backing Matthew Hayden 10 days out of 10 or anyone else who wants to talk about it."
Pakistan will play three Tests against Australia, with the series- opener beginning at the WACA Ground tomorrow week.
While acknowledging Shoaib's bullet-like pace was a rare weapon, Langer also said it could work against him. "He's fast, he's exciting and you know you're alive when you're facing him," he said.
"But as a batsman I've always felt you can score runs against him because he'll give you one that's a bit fuller or short that you cut away. Hopefully he's not the worst bloke to bat against."
The Pakistanis will fine-tune their Test preparations with a four- day game against Western Australia at the WACA starting tomorrow. It will be the third warm-up match for the tourists, who arrived a week earlier than usual to adapt to Australian conditions.
By the time the first Test begins, Pakistan would have been in Perth for 17 days.
