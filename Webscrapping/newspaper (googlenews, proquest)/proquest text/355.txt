ADELAIDE’S cloud invoice exchange system developer Link4 is gearing up to enter the UK market next year on its own – but it has also received a royal tick of approval in the lead up to the move.
The company has cleared one leg of the Duke of York, Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace Australia competition.
Link4 has developed a simple cloud-based invoice exchange service that allows a business to send invoices direct to their client’s accounting system, speeding up payments and eliminating data entry and other errors.
It will be one of 24 participants at a bootcamp today, pitching for one of 12 spots at a final pitching event in December. The events are part of the Pitch@Palace global initiative that started in 2016 and is designed to build a global community of entrepreneurs.
Link4 chief executive Robin Sands said the company was one of eight and the only South Australian, to be selected at the Melbourne event last week.
“We are thrilled to be selected, especially as we gain momentum with a number of projects coming up and the setting up of our London office in April,” he said.
“Our move to UK is timed to make the most of the opportunities that will come with the local government making e-invoicing mandatory from 2018.”Link4, established in March last year, will be running a three-month pilot with the NSW Government and is close to signing a six-month deal with the Federal Government. BOC Gas will trial the invoice system with 1000 customers.
