COMMERCIALISATION Australia has named two new SA-based entrepreneurs to its case manager network as demand for assistance grows.
Investment management specialist Ann Angel and industrial designer Grant Steinberg will help participants through the commercialisation process.
Case managers help commercialisation program participants bring their ideas to market and aim to accelerate the business building process.
In the past two years, the case manager network has helped 248 innovators, who have received $97.1 million in funding from Commercialisation Australia.
Current SA program participants include: Re-Time, which is working to commercialise light therapy glasses for the treatment of insomnia and related issues; Signostics, which has developed a hand-held ultrasound device for a range of clinical uses; and Real Time Data, which has developed Deckhand, a portable electronic logbook for commercial fishermen.
Commercialisation Australia chief executive Doron Ben-Meir said Ms Angel and Mr Steinberg had a strong track record of guiding companies through the commercialisation process.
"Their addition to the program will strengthen Commercialisation Australia's ability to make a real difference to Australia's budding inventors and entrepreneurs," he said.
"I am delighted to welcome them all on board."
The program is delivered by the Federal Government.
Commercialisation Australia provides grant funding for specialist advice and services, experienced executives, proof of concept and early stage commercialisation activities.
