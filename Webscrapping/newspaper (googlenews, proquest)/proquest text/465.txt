ZIMBABWE coach Geoff Marsh believes Australia has no option but to keep picking Steve Waugh amid claims the Australian skipper has been put on notice by national selectors.
It has been reported that chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns has warned Waugh that he is a series-by-series proposition, despite scoring 534 runs at 184 in his past six innings.
Speaking after rain washed out play on the fourth day of the first Test at the WACA Ground yesterday, Marsh said Waugh's selection should be a non-issue.
"He batted very well in the first innings," Marsh said.
"I think Stephen just lets his batting do the talking. I think he's averaging about 80 in his last 10 Test matches. You can't argue with that."
The comments are significant given Marsh once said that the lure of big money would prolong players' careers to the point where selectors would need to tap them on the shoulder.
Marsh, a former team-mate of Waugh and later a national selector and coach, said Waugh's age should not be a roadblock to his goal of playing through to India next September.
"I think with Stephen, he is batting so well and there's no reason to leave him out," he said.
"If you weren't talking age, you wouldn't be asking the question. It's just an age thing. But Stephen is actually peforming well and doing well under pressure so if he's scoring runs at this level and doing it well, there's no reason to change it."
With Australia needing one wicket to record a first Test victory on today's final day of the first Test, the Zimbabweans are hoping forecasts of a day of rain are correct.
"We just want to do the best we possibly can," Marsh said. "We have taken Australia to the fifth day and not too many sides have done that in the past few years. It is obviously a very good wicket and tomorrow we will try to bat as well as we can. The two guys in can bat, don't worry."
