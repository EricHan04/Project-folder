Tiffany De Sousa Machado is proof you can thrive after divorce
“I was with my ex-husband, Craig, for 14 years before we separated. Things started to go downhill after the birth of our daughter, Faith, now eight. I experienced postnatal depression, had no family support and put a lot of pressure on him to be everything. He was dealing with his own issues at the time and, although we tried counselling for nine months, we eventually realised our relationship was over.
From the beginning, I was adamant we would have an amicable split. I didn’t want our separation to affect Faith’s relationship with her dad. I have always spoken highly of him and allowed him to see her whenever he wanted. When things got tough, I’d remind myself of happier times. It’s easy to blame the other person in a separation, but I think it’s more effective to try to see things from their perspective.
Now, almost six years later, we’ve both found love again and I have a great relationship with Craig and his partner, Michele. My partner James and I have a one-year-old baby girl, Rumi, and Craig is her favourite person aside from me and her dad! We share everything from Christmas and birthdays to school concerts. It took us time to get to this point, but I chose to see our separation as a chance for growth.
Because of the isolation I felt in the early stages of our break-up, I was motivated to create a platform that enabled parents to connect with and learn from one other, so I launched the Village Foundation App (villagefoundation app.com).It’s important to have as much support as possible when you’re going through a separation and that’s exactly what we aim to provide.”
