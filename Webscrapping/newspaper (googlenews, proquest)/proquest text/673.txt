A SOUTH Australian medical devices company has been ordered to pay a former executive $140,112.67 in back pay and unpaid incentives as well as $110,000 in penalties for forging a pay slip.
Signostics Ltd, which pioneered handheld ultrasound technology, has already been placed in liquidation and its ability to pay the hefty fine and back pay to its former chief operating officer is in doubt.
The company was the recipient of a $1.96 million commercialisation grant from the Australian Government in 2011 to help build a second generation device.
Stewart Gavin Bartlett was employed by Signostics between January 2005 and August 2017. Global private equity giant KKR paid $US35 million for a stake in the company in 2015. It has since been placed in liquidation.
Federal Circuit Court judge Timothy Heffernan handed down a scathing ruling on Monday which concluded fellow executives of Signostics had a “malign intent” towards Mr Bartlett.
The court previously heard the former executive had accepted a pay cut to his salary during the 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis.
The company’s board made a deal with Mr Bartlett that if he could raise $10 million or more at the next capital-raising event he would be paid $40,126 – the difference in his salary.
The company also offered him a $40,000 incentive to contract the company with a widescale manufacturer and a further $20,000 if he achieved regulatory approval for the product in Australia and the US.
Signostics entered into a manufacturing contract with Japanese technology company Konica Minolta on June 21, 2012.
The company received approval to distribute their products in Australia in February 2013 and in the US in April 13.
KKR subsidiary Echonous entered into a mergers-and-acquisition agreement with Signostics for $10 million in November 2015.
Despite meeting all three of the targets, Mr Bartlett was not paid any of the incentive costs. Towards the end of his time with the company, he was told of plans to close the Adelaide manufacturing arm of the operation and retrench most of the company’s Australian employees.
Mr Bartlett offered to be retrenched, but was denied.
He resigned on February 13, 2017, and officially left the company on August 11, 2017.
When he asked for back pay on 426.4 hours of annual leave, Mr Bartlett was shown a pay slip which showed he was only owed 81.85 hours.
“The document disclosed by (Signostics) during the course of proceedings is a forgery,” Judge Heffernan said.
“No other reasonable inference is open.“Further, (Signostics) was, as I have already found, motivated in its actions by bad faith towards (Mr Bartlett).”
