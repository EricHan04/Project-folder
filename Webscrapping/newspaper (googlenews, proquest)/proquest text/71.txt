But, just as the PHOS-Camden Football Club on-baller was readying himself to take on the Big V, he received another offer.
Callum had been picked to[226 128 137 ]represent Australia in the[226 128 137 ]US in the Cal Ripken World Series junior baseball championship - the event clashing with the Aussie rules championships.
"I was a bit sad because I had to choose between my two favourite sports because[226 128 137 ]I love them both," Callum says.
"But it was also really, really exciting because I[226 128 137 ]couldn't believe I was going to get the chance to go[226 128 137 ]to America to play for[226 128 137 ]Australia, "I got some advice that it was a pretty special opportunity to play for Australia that I might never get again.
"With football, there will hopefully be more chances." With that, the Adelaide Angels junior decided to don the green and gold in Baltimore next month.
Callum, a Plympton Primary School student. earned the chance to represent Australia after an outstanding performance for SA at the recent national championship in Queensland, in June.
