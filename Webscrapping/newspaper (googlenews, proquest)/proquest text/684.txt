A HAND-HELD ultrasound device which could help reduce the rate of patient hospital visits is in the running to win an Australian International Design Award.
SA-based firm Signostics is one of two local companies to be nominated for an award. The other is Electrolux, for its En-V Barbecue.
Signostics chief operating officer Stewart Bartlett said the pocket-size ultrasound system was one of the most affordable on the market and had taken 18 months to develop. It retails for about $4000, compared to a larger machine which would have a minimum price tag of $30,000.
"The sort of applications it is used for are those which are really simple," he said. "It could be used in palliative care or in emergency medicine when someone turns up with trauma injuries and there could be fluid in the abdomen."
Furthermore, the device enabled people to have ultrasounds at home, ensuring they did not have to make hospital visits - saving the patient discomfort and hospitals unnecessary costs.
