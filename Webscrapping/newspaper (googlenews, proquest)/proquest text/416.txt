Think printed history only comes in books or photographs?
Well, Springton Primary School students have shown that it can be printed, too.
Students have designed and created objects using Makers Empire software and their 3D printer to help bring the stories of children who attended the Friedensberg German School between 1861 and 1913 to life.
The title translates as 'Small Objects - Big Stories'.
The school has been participating in an innovative partnership program with Friedensberg German School Museum, History SA and Makers Empire.
The exhibition was open to the public for History Month at the museum on May 31.
The display will also be presented at a showcase event with other schools in Adelaide later this month.
This project follows on from students having designed models of artefacts or structures associated with WWI.
These formed part of our Anzac Day display which was on show at the Mount Pleasant Soldier's Memorial Hall during the this year's commemoration.
These tasks have helped form strong connections between the lives of students today, and, with empathy and a greater understanding of, events in our past.
Well done, Springton Primary School.
