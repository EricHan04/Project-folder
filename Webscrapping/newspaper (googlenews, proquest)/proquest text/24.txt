THE Adelaide Angels Baseball Club is hoping its highest number of junior players in years will help it make a successful impact on the field.
The club, based at Urrbrae Tce, Plympton, is fielding 11 teams in the SA Baseball League this season. They range from division one through to the Under 12s.
Club president Greg Frick said the club was in excellent shape.
"We are healthy in all grades," Mr Frick said.
"It's always a battle being a smaller club to keep the finances in check, but we're hoping for a good season."
Mr Frick said the club had recently started Aussie T-Ball on Friday nights to attract children aged six to eight to the sport.
He said the Angels' division one side had made a "cracking start" to its 2011-12 campaign, with two convincing wins.
Division one coach Ben Catalano said the start had given hope to the side, after a string of disappointing seasons.
"We're sitting second at the moment, which is great given that in the last few seasons we've struggled to make the finals," Mr Catalano said.
Mr Catalano said the team trained solidly in the off-season to turn around its fortunes.
"We managed to recruit a couple of players and had a long pre-season," he said.
