ADELAIDE company Lateral Vision is seeing a new future for its virtual, augmented and mixed reality technology in the field of training. In partnership with TAFE SA at Tonsley, the company is helping a pilot batch of students on identifying hazards and risk in a supermarket plant room and working with new refrigerants in a real-world setting. Co-founded by Laura Tolson (pictured left), Lateral Vision has also developed virtual tours for Adelaide Oval and helped visitors to the Monarto Zoo get a sneak preview of what to expect at the Lions 360 Experience.PAGE 25
