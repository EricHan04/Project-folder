THE South Australian Government has given $1.7 million in grants to boost high-value businesses.
The South Australian Micro Finance Fund is part of the State Government's $60 million Our Jobs Plan. This year the SAMFF has approved 10 successful applicants, who will each receive the maximum grant of $50,000.
The capped funding, which is provided on a 2:1 basis, is intended to keep the creation, development and commercialisation of intellectual property funded through the project in South Australia.
Makers Empire is a 3-D printing learning program designed for schools. Some of its grant will be used to collaborate with distributors in Hong Kong as a way to enter the Chinese market.
Businesses also developing their ideas under grants from the SAMFF include ODD Games, MakeSafe Pty Ltd, eSMART 21, Soldales Pacific, PT BIZ Pty Ltd, JingSu, Personify and Six Foot Kid and Money Buddy.
Manufacturing and Innovation Minister Kyam Maher said the SAMFF aims to make SA businesses and ideas more globally competitive."Assisting entrepreneurs to develop their ideas and find new markets for their products will help the State Government achieve one of our key economic priorities - growth through innovation," he said.
