THE Adelaide Angels' under-14 baseball side has won a gold medal in the Outback Games in Broken Hill during the week.
The side was awarded the medal after finishing top of the three- team competition with four wins and two draws.
Game one of the final day panned out to be the gold-medal match with the suburban side thrashing Broken Hill Gold 11-2.
"They (Broken Hill) probably lacked the intensity (of the Angels) but we were a little lucky at crucial times during some of the matches," Angels' spokesman Peter Slee said.
