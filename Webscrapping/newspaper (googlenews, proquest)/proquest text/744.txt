WEEKS after creating Australia’s newest unicorn – a company with a value of more than $1 billion – Culture Amp founder Didier Elzinga will be in Adelaide to share the experience.
Mr Elzinga, who previously led Adelaide special effects company Rising Sun Pictures, is one of the speakers at next month’s SouthStart conference.
In early September, Melbourne-based Mr Elzinga’s 2009-established Culture Amp, a software business aimed at improving workplace culture, raised $US82 million from some of the world’s leading investors, taking its valuation to $US700 million ($1.03 billion). Other speakers include Shark Tank’s Steve Baxter and Google Creative Lab director Tea Uglow, NASA's Dr Christyl Johnson, Chester Osborn from d’Arenberg and Mark Reading from Atlassian. SouthStart is part of a week-long, multi-venue program focused on entrepreneurialism. The two-day conference kicks off on November 20 at the Convention Centre, with more than 70 speakers exploring developments in AI, space, creative industries, agtech and blockchain technologies.
SouthStart event director, Craig Swann has described it as a “convergence of humans, impact and technology”.
“The entrepreneurial path is a hard and often lonely road. SouthStart provides a unique experience for people to come together offline, connect as humans and acquire the networks, skills and knowledge to tackle the problems that will affect billions of people.”DETAILS: SOUTHSTART.CO
