A GROUP of science loving Adelaide pupils is bringing natural wonders to life in holographic images.
Year 10 and 11 students at the Australian Science and Mathematics School are working with Voxon Photonics to create and project colour holograms including prosthetic hands, MRI and CAT scans, waterfalls, animals and cartoon characters.
One group made an interactive 3D map for visitors to the school. “It’s almost like Google maps except it’s in 3D,” teacher Maja Williams said.
The students took photos of the school and used software to create a 360 degree map.
Year 10 student Marvelous Ogbeide, 16, said it started with an initial idea about making a video on school life.“It is hard work. You have to take perfect photos. The program has to measure every single inch of the photo and then put it on a real size scale so it can transfer them and stitch the images together into a 3D model.,” she said.
