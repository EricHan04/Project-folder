A NEW electricity company, based at Lot Fourteen, has launched, offering cheap prices to consumers who use power in the middle of the day.
IO Energy will take advantage of new tariffs on distribution and low mid-day prices from generators.
Using power between 10am and 3pm would cost 8c per kilowatt hour, but in the evening it would cost up to $1.25/kWh in summer on one of IO Energy’s payment plans.
“You can get enormous savings from using daytime electricity,” chief operating officer Luke Morton said.
The plans would suit homes without solar, such as apartments or those with too much shade on the roof.
Customers could install a battery, charge it using cheap prices, then power the home at night.
“We think SA is the best place in the world for our business model,” Mr Morton said.
The IO Energy offer, which has four residential plans, will be run in conjunction with retailer Energy Locals. Major retailers, including AGL, also have started to introduce time-of-use plans, which offer cheap daytime rates or use other ways of shifting energy use, such as Origin Energy’s rewards program.
