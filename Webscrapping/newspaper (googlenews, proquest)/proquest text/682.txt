ADELAIDE firm Signostics has won a design award for its hand-held ultrasound device as it moves to expand its presence in Europe.
Signostics' device - the Signos - won best product design, in the medical and scientific category, at the Melbourne Design Awards.
In November, the company launched the Signos in Europe and had signed a distribution deal in Italy. Signostics' chief operating officer Stewart Bartlett said similar agreements would soon be signed with other European countries, including Portugal and France.
He said the award was a testament to the "outstanding engineering" of the Signos.
"From a customer's perspective, it's always good to know that a product has been recognised independently as a well-designed and high-quality product," he said. "(The Signos) is especially appealing to the medical industry because it can save time and money. The product is giving physicians and hospitals, globally, a cost-effective means to use ultrasound at the bedside and help reduce clinical risks associated with common procedures such as fluid drainage."
