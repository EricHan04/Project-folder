INDUSTRY association Startup Adelaide has added fresh blood to the local start-up community with two new directors.
Accountancy firm Cirillo Hooper's Chris Hooper and global app develop David Truong will be passing the baton on to co-working space Majoran's new managing director Aainaa Rahman and sharemarket website ShareScene founder Geoff Kwitko.
Startup Adelaide is a self-governing advocate body which supports the local start-up community with resources, networking and training.
Director Geoff Kwitko says Adelaide is ready for strong investment. "Adelaide has finally gotten over the illusion of low self esteem ... and no longer using the excuse of being in Adelaide to justify their failures," he said.
He said a large part of seed funding and angel investment should come from local businesses, who were investing in property and shares.
"They are backing, in my opinion, the wrong companies - the companies which have had their growth," Mr Kwitko said.
Existing director Orren Pruncken said Startup Adelaide continued to empower people to join the community and attract foreign talent to upskill local entrepreneurs.
"Now we're looking at how to inspired - how to get people who might have an idea and go from there to make it happen," he said.
The Unley Australia Day Citizen of the Year said the recent sixth Startup Weekend, a biannual event where developers, designers and marketers come together to create a start-up, has attracted more new faces than past events.Startup Adelaide will also have a new website which featured a map cataloguing local start-ups, government and private networks for entrepreneurs.
