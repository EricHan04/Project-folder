A CHANCE meeting at Pulteney Grammar School about 18 months ago has progressed to wedding bells for Tina Walker and Scott Evans.
The Modbury North couple met when Tina was working as a cleaner at the school and Scott visited to see his father, Robert, who works there as a maintenance officer.
"They have not been apart since," the groom's happy father said. "It was a true case of love at first sight and it is great to see it produce a wonderful wedding like this."
About 160 guests attended the wedding at the North Adelaide Uniting Church where the bride arrived in a horse and carriage.
In a romantic twist, Tina's parents were married in the same church 36 years ago.
Lisa, daughter of Mr and Mrs Peter Hoffmann, of Salisbury, married Dean, son of Mr and Mrs Edmund Zarasinski, of Hillbank, in Spicer Uniting Church, St Peters.
