TECHNOLOGY developed in Adelaide is helping relatives keep tabs on vulnerable elderly family members in care.
In the wake of the Oakden and other aged care scandals the link’s creator says it can give families peace of mind while allowing care teams to better monitor people in residential care and receiving home care.
CareApp is a smartphone app allowing carers to photograph, with permission, people in care while updating their records, noting anything from physical and mood changes through to whether they are taking medication, even if they are washing regularly. Family members can view the information on their smartphones.
CareApp founder Allison Nikula said the app could help avoid a repeat of recent aged care scandals, and noted the use by multiple carers would help ensure no single carer can cover up signs of problems. Ms Nikula is an occupational therapist and graduate of Business SA’s SA Young Entrepreneur Scheme who previously led a team of more than 440 community care workers at an aged care provider.
The technology has been trialled by St Louis Home Care since January last year and is being rolled out to its more than 250 clients and their families across Adelaide and Victor Harbor and in its Parkside nursing home. It also is being piloted by three Meals on Wheels branches in NSW.
“We are bridging the knowledge gap between a family member, their loved one, the carer and aged care provider,” Ms Nikula said.Debbie Bain uses the app to receive regular updates on her aunt Mary Barnes at the St Louis Nursing Home at Parkside: “It’s not always easy to visit as much as we’d like, but with this technology we feel like we can be part of her day.”
