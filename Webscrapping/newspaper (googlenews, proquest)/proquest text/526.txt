Match of the day
THE first meeting between Emilie Schulze and Matthew Rasheed occurred when they were 12-year-old students appearing in a musical presented jointly by their schools, Annesley College and Prince Alfred College.
When they met again four years later in another school musical they began a relationship which culminated in marriage after Emilie proposed to Matthew during a romantic dinner.
"It was a spur of the moment decision," laughed Emilie.
After leaving school, Emilie studied health sciences at Flinders University and Matthew gained a Bachelor of Business from the University of South Australia. She now works in marketing, co- ordinating client projects while he works in training and development at Mitsubishi.
Both 22, they married at Flinders Street Baptist Church, Adelaide, and are honeymooning on Hayman Island.
