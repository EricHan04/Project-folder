FLAGSTAFF HILL
Many children spend their spare time playing video games or watching TV, but a pair of entrepreneurial siblings in Adelaide’s south are instead focused on growing their own start-up business.
Elliott Thornhill, 12, and sister Jessica, 9, of Flagstaff Hill, have sold hundreds of manufactured products since establishing their start-up business G3D Printing Solutions.
Elliott says he was introduced to the technology by local start-up Makers Empire, which provides 3D printing software and learning programs to more than 1000 primary schools across four countries.
“At school, me and my friends thought that it would be a good idea to run a skateboarding business but nobody was committed to starting it up so that failed,” Elliott says.
“But then, once I knew how to 3D print, I thought this would be a great idea for a business and that’s where it all started.
“We thought it would be a great idea to attend local markets to sell our products and show people the technology we use.” The Thornhills spend more than 20 hours a week on their business, using four 3D printers to manufacture a wide range of products including bag tags, custom cake toppers and pet tags.
They run market stalls and sell products via Facebook, delivering across Australia and New Zealand.
Since it was established in 2014 as part of ANZ’s Innovyz accelerator program, Makers Empire has grown its workforce to 17 and currently generates annual revenue of more than $2 million. With the company targeting annual growth of 50 per cent to 100 per cent, founder and chief executive Jon Soong says his focus remains on reaching out to more schools and educating children such as Elliott and Jessica.
“They’re learning all the skills you need to sell something and create a business,” Mr Soong says.“They’re so enthusiastic – it’s a pretty crazy story.”
