THE dominance of Google as Australian consumers' search engine of choice means businesses must understand online advertising or risk missing vital sales opportunities, online search firm DBG Technologies says.
DBG director Luke Jamieson said Google accounted for about 94 per cent of the online search market in Australia. "There is a program called Google AdWords that allows companies to pay a fee each time a person clicks on their ad," he said. "We usually suggest people pick five to 10 specifically targeted keywords that can be linked to their ads. DBG said there were tips to follow when planning a campaign:
CHOOSE specific keywords to display your ads and ensure the ad design is enticing.
CREATE a customised "landing page" on your website that is tailored to what the customer has searched for. This may include specials or discounts.
CALCULATE a return on investment by setting a budget. This will ensure you can measure click costs against sales profits.
START small with a few keywords and a low budget. Set up the free Google Analytics software to create reports of website statistics on visitor numbers and traffic patterns.
