MY MEMORIES OF THE OVAL GEOF MOTLEY Favourite end to kick to: "Whichever my team was kicking to - that's where you scored the most. It made no difference." Biggest crowd you played in front of: "62,543 - the Oval's record in the 1965 grand final against Sturt." Best moment at the ground: "No question - the 1959 grand final. We won six in a row to create the Australian record and it was the most important game of my career, following Foster Williams as our coach." GEOF MOTLEY holds the record of nine SANFL premierships won as a player while representing Port Adelaide from 1953-1966 and winning the Magarey Medalin 1964.
