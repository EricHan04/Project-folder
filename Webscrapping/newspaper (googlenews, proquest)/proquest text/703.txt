INTERNATIONAL businessman Raymond Spencer will take on the key role of chairman of the Economic Development Board.
He replaces Bruce Carter, who stood down in December.
Mr Spencer will take up his appointment immediately and will also assume Mr Carter's role on the executive committee of State Cabinet.
The board, which was formed by Premier Mike Rann when he became Premier in 2002, provides advice to the Government on economic development issues.
Mr Rann said Mr Spencer had invaluable experience in international business, management, planning, technology and finance. "Raymond brings a wealth of experience to the role ranging from working with large corporations to small community organisations," Mr Rann said.
Mr Spencer is also chairman of the SA Health and Medical Research Institute, chairman of Capgemini's Financial Services Global Business Unit and chairman of Signostics.
He has been a member of the EDB since August last year and returned to Australia in 2009 after 35 years of living and working in the US, India and Europe.
Mr Spencer said he saw potential for real growth in areas such as clean technology, renewables, education and health, a potential he was "very excited by".
