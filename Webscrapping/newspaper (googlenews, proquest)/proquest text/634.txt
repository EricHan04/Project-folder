The latest pulse crop research and how to utilise new technology to maximise yield potential and limit chemical use are topics that will be discussed by key speakers at the Hart field day on September 18.
Canberra-based consultant Rohan Rainbow leads the speaker line-up. Mr Rainbow is a well-known industry leader in the Mid North district and will provide insight about his research on the benefits for growers of introducing new technology.
"Rohan will speak about 'putting new technology in farmers' hands', giving guidelines on chemical use, regulation and new technologies on-farm," Hart Field-Site Group chairman Damien Sommerville, Spalding, said.
WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development research officer Georgie Troup and SARDI principle oat breeder Pamela Zwer will discuss oaten hay, and how to improve yield and quality.
Spalding grower Darren Longmire and agronomist Stuart Sherriff will inform growers about the benefits of the Harrington seed Destructor and Seed Terminator.
"And a really timely topic will be the construction of the new weather station network for the Mid North and what it means in terms of access to more information for local growers," Mr Sommerville said.
Three new lentil and faba bean varieties will be announced at the field day by Pulse Breeding Australia, SARDI and the University of Adelaide.
