MANUFACTURING A COMMON plastic used in everything from water bottles to plastic bags could protect combat vehicles from deadly bomb attacks.
World-leading breakthrough research in Australia has discovered that polyethylene -- the world's most produced plastic polymer -- has the potential to increase resistance of armoured vehicles to roadside bombs and rocket attacks.
Melbourne-based Long Nguyen from Australia's Defence Science Technology Group was this week awarded the 2016 Land Defence Australia Young Innovator Scholarship.
Dr Nguyen (pictured) developed a mathematical model that predicts how the polyethylene composite armour performs under ballistic impacts and a computer model that can simulate behaviour of the armour under high impact.
Dr Nguyen said the toughened plastic composite armour could also reduce the weight of heavy land-based vehicles by up to a third, improving fuel efficiency and speed of the vehicles.
"If you look at the Bushmaster, it weighs about 15 tonnes -- and the Hawkei weighs about 10 tonnes -- and a lot of that weight is contributed to armour," he said of vehicles in service and about to enter service for the Australian Army.
"The other issue with metals is if you get a puncture or perforation you get a lot of shrapnel that comes behind it. (Polyethylene) holds its shape quite well." Dr Nguyen was among 16 defence industry innovators named as finalists in the industry innovation awards, presented at the 2016 Land Forces event in Adelaide.
Melbourne company Australian Defence Apparel won the national innovation award for developing an adjustable backpack frame, which is being supplied to the Australian Army.Sydney company Marathon Targets received the small and medium enterprise innovation grant for its autonomous robotic small-arms target system.
