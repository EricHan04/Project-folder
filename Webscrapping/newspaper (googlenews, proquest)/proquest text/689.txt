A TEAM of new business mentors is the latest tenant to jump on board a high-profile industry and education precinct 12km south of Adelaide's CBD.
Innovyz Start Institute - a South Australian small business accelerator program that has helped 45 companies raise nearly $20 million in committed funds since its launch in February 2012 - is to open an office at the Tonsley innovation hub.
"We'll be commencing the new program in March with eight companies focused on health and wellness products, services and software. They'll spend nine months being nurtured by the Innovyz mentor network," Innovyz executive chairman Philip Vafiadis said.
An advanced manufacturing mentoring program was also in the pipeline for the first half of 2015, said Mr Vafiadis.
He explained Innovyz would focus on five separate business streams at Tonsley: medical, resources and energy, advanced manufacturing, applied technology and water.
The companies on board the Innovyz program would need to become "globally relevant", said Mr Vafiadis, who also confirmed the Department for State Development and Adelaide City Council had strongly backed the move.
"The Government gets slammed for this stuff all the time (but) it needs support - something profound is happening at Innovyz. We are interested in companies that are making stuff that matters and not just making stuff." The expansion aligns with the "Growth through innovation" economic priority set out as part of the State Government's 10 economic objectives, Innovation Minister Susan Close said, adding: "The SA Government is transforming Tonsley into a collaborative and high-value industry, education and residential precinct . . . the sort of environment that suits a program such as Innovyz." The Innovyz Tonsley office will be based above medical devices entrepreneurs Signostics within the old Mitsubishi headquarters on South Rd.It will also have a presence within the Adelaide CBD.
