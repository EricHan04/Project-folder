INTERACTIVE toys that challenge and educate will be among favourite presents this Christmas.
A list of 10 toys put out by Dreamcoat features several "activation" toys proven to be mentally stimulating. From watching "aliens" and ants at work, to puzzle books, magic kits and pyjamas that teach you to spell, children can have fun as they learn.
The Roboreptile, an interactive, seeing and hearing cyber- reptilian, is expected to sell well.
That also is the case for the Yoho Lightwave Twirling Staff and the Antworks ant farm. The list also features the RS Media, which is a robot complete with a chest-mounted LCD screen, 50MB of internal memory and the ability to download images, MP3 and MPEG files.
The Test Tube Alien was created by JP toys to encourage boys to nurture.
"There really hasn't been a strong nurturing or interactive program created for boys," marketing director Robert Macolino said. "While girls will use and enjoy them, too, they are designed to be a really cool and gross science experiment to teach boys to care for something."
The good or evil aliens evolve from a chrysalis to 15cm high Test Tube Aliens under the supervision of their carer.
The technology, similar to that of a Tamagotchi, encourages the carer to feed them the right amounts of water and nutrient rich alien slime.
Sacha Laing of David Jones said interactive toys were always popular.
"Learning and development toys continue to be top of our customers' shopping lists," she said. "There are also some great new products coming through from Fisher Price as part of the Laugh and Learn and Fun To Learn ranges."
Ms Laing agreed the Robosapien range would make a great present.
"We are expecting Robosapien to have another very strong year this year," she said.
"There are new items coming into the range, including a new Reptile and a new Robot with some amazing technological advancements."
