PREMIER Steven Marshall will today reveal the name of South Australia’s first ever satellite at the 12th Australian Space Forum.
A local school will be announced as the winner of the naming competition for the SA Space Services Mission satellite, which is due to be launched into low Earth orbit next year.
The satellite is the first ever to be manufactured in SA.
Mr Marshall will be joined by NASA astronaut and physicist Dr Shannon Walker, a headline speaker at the forum held at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
The forum, hosted by the Andy Thomas Space Foundation, will focus on international space trends and how to advance SA’s satellite manufacturing capabilities. “Despite challenging times, South Australia’s vibrant space ecosystem is thriving and I look forward to seeing our space industry continue on its upward trajectory,” Mr Marshall said.
