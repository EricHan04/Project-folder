AN SA medical devices company which pioneered handheld ultrasound systems for global markets with the backing of Australian taxpayers and investors has been placed in liquidation by its US parent.
The appointment of liquidator Anthony Phillips, of Heard Phillips, on Friday marks the end of Signostics, which was founded in 2005.
Mr Phillips told The Advertiser he was waiting on paperwork to determine the exact financial position of the company.
“From what I understand there is one disputed debt and all of the assets were sold to the parent company. It was an assetless entity,” he said.
Global private equity giant KKR paid $US35 million for a stake in 2015. The deal saw Signostics redomiciled to the US, subsequently becoming a subsidiary of EchoNous, a US-based company in KKR’s portfolio.
KKR’s investment was going to fast track research and development activity at its SA operations at Tonsley. In then chairman David Keogh’s words “the equity buy-in would help create a centre for excellence in R&D and medical technology manufacturing” at Tonsley. Yesterday, Mr Keogh said: “We regret the closure of Signostics, but the decision was made in the best interest of the stockholders of Signostics, who are now stockholders of its US parent, EchoNous. The company does not wish to make any further comments.”When KKR came in 2015, Signostics employed 17 staff, including co-founder Stewart Bartlett, at Tonsley. Mr Bartlett, who deferred comments to management, established the business with his brother Neil and Glenn Costa in 2005. He left Signostics in 2017 shortly before the business moved out of Tonsley. Signostics, which recieved millions from investors and through state and federal grants, including $2 million from Commercialisation Australia, now just has a distribution office in Adelaide.
