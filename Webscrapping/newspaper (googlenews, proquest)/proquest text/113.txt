AUSTRALIAN Fashion Week’s 25th birthday celebrations are going ahead and Adelaide’s Akiima has been helping get the party started.
The New York-based supermodel, pictured, who has been here visiting family and friends, has been in Sydney for a special fashion week announcement.
Shelved this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the annual event will celebrate its 25th year in 2021 as Afterpay Australian Fashion Week, ­replacing Mercedes Benz, which has been the naming partner for more than a decade. Participation fees for those wanting to show their collections have also been waived to encourage ­designers and support the industry.
Vogue Australia’s Edwina ­McCann was present for the announcement, along with designer Carla Zampatti, inset.
Discovered by Finesse Models Australia in 2017, Akiima made her runway debut in Sydney walking for Carla. Next, she appeared at Australian Fashion Week, ahead of her launch overseas where she’s modelled for brands such as Chanel and Prada. SA labels who have previously shown at Australian Fashion Week include Acler, C/MEO Collective and AZZO swimwear by Port Pirie-born Michael Azzollini.
