THE North American director of a major Adelaide conference for entrepreneurs says the state would benefit from an influx of enterprising talent from overseas.
Canadian-born Craig Swann, who runs SouthStart, migrated to Australia a year ago after spending a decade in New York.
“It was difficult for me coming here to go through the visa process and I know I’m no special case,” Mr Swann said.
“If you could get 100 more people from my network here it would be a different environment. We need to find more entrepreneurs that have international business experience, people with an understanding of global marketing.
“It’s really key to find that kind of mindset and perspective to add to the technology we have here.”Mr Swann, founder of cloud-based music studio Looplabs, said fellowships could be another lure for entrepreneurs.
