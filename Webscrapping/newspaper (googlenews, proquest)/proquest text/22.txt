SPORTING groups that use Weigall Oval Reserve are divided on the need for a dog park.
Adelaide Cobras Football Club vice-chairman John Pirintzis said a fenced dog park was unnecessary because the pets were already allowed off-leash on Weigall Oval.
"Why do you have to spend $150,000 to close them up?" he said.
Mr Pirintzis said spending money on a dog park would be "a kick in the teeth" for the soccer club, which shares clubrooms with Adelaide Angels Baseball Club at the reserve and has long been lobbying the council for more storage space.
Angels president Stuart Batchelor said his club did not object to a dog park, but that it should be on the other side of the oval from the clubrooms so junior players would not be at risk from dogs and their owners would be safe from fly balls.
Angels groundsman Greg Frick backed the deferral, after the club's submission said it would be "shortsighted" to put in a dog park before planning was completed for the whole reserve.
