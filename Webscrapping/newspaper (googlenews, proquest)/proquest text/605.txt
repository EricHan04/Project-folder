A $50 MILLION State Government venture capital fund to support South Australian companies will be managed by Blue Sky Venture Capital, which will expand its Adelaide office, under a deal announced yesterday.
Brisbane-based Blue Sky Venture Capital, which specialises in providing late-stage venture capital and early expansion capital to Australian companies, will work with businesses and organisations to identify high-growth potential SA companies for investment and help attract additional private sector funding.
The company was selected following a tender process and comes after The Advertiser revealed in May the firm was the frontrunner for managing the SAVCF. Elaine Stead, head of venture capital at Blue Sky, will lead management of the fund.
Adelaide University educated Dr Stead is from SA and has more than 10 years’ experience as a venture capitalist, specialising in technology commercialisation.
“Blue Sky has a long history of partnering with SA businesses, and we are excited about applying our venture capital expertise to help early stage companies realise their full growth potential in national and international markets,” she said.
“We are looking forward to playing an active, hands-on role in supporting the dynamic SA start-up sector.” The company manages $3 billion worth of investments across infrastructure, real estate and private equity and has delivered a 25.4 per cent gross internal rate of return.
The company has offices in Australia – including Gawler Place, Adelaide – and New York and has invested more than $250 million in SA businesses that employ about 1000 people.Premer Jay Weatherill said the VC fund would support “innovative businesses to become more competitive” and stimulate economic activity.
