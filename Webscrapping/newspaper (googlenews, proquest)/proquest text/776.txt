HE believes Adelaide’s start-up scene is only just beginning, and Craig Swann, pictured, is hoping a reinvigorated SouthStart can kickstart the city’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.
Mr Swann — who only arrived in Adelaide for a holiday less than a year ago — is hoping to make his mark in the start-up community as event director of the SouthStart conference.
Some of South Australia’s and the world’s best start-ups and entrepreneurs will be taking part in the two-day event.
“The start-up community here has so much potential, but it is a little bit fragmented,” he said.
“Hopefully this can inspire and ignite the community.”SouthStart will be held on November 22 and 23 at Adelaide Town Hall.
