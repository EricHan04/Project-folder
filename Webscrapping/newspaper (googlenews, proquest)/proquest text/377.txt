DURING their last semester at university, Daniel Wilson and Luke Jamieson set up their own website design company in Mr Wilson's father's Salisbury North home.
Ten years later, the two 31-year-olds head website specialist company DBG Technologies with 11 staff, an office in Pirie St, expansion interstate and are on the lookout for larger premises after picking up 14 new contracts last month.
"By the end of next year we're looking to have 18 people on staff," Mr Wilson said.
He said the company client base was about 300 and DBG had just launched a new high-profile website for the visual arts festival SALA in a record eight weeks.
"Adelaide is a great place to work in because it's so small. There's a lot of competition and you have to be really good at your job," Mr Wilson said.
It helped them successfully establish a virtual office in Melbourne about 18 months ago. Staff make regular trips to meet clients and Mr Wilson said 20 per cent of the company turnover was now being generated from work in Victoria. He believed DBG had been successful because it was able to integrate websites with any software or third-party package.
The company, which counts Optus, Brock Real Estate and Vodafone among its clients, ensures it stays on top of technology because "things change every few months so anything you've done three months before is almost outdated".
It won the contract to create a new website for the SALA (South Australian Living Artists) Festival late last year, and stepped up as a Premier Partner of the festival.
