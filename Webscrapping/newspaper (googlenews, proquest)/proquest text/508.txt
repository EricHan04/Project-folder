AN Adelaide company building groundbreaking X-ray robots to detect bombs is among seven South Australian businesses to benefit from a federal government grant worth more than $3.5m.
Industry, Science and Technology Minister Christian Porter has announced the businesses will receive funding from the second round of the manufacturing modernisation fund.
Micro-X Ltd will get a $400,000 chunk of the fund to go towards building a new $3.3m manufacturing facility at Tonsley.
The company will develop and build portable X-ray machines to be used by military, police and security agencies to detect and counter improvised explosive devices.
The current practice worldwide is to manually place an X-ray device next to the suspected bomb, causing significant safety issues for technicians.
However, Micro-X’s new “backscatter” technology allows bomb technicians to send out a robot with a lightweight X-ray device attached to scan for suspected explosives.
Managing director Peter Rowland said the funding would help the company continue “investing in innovation and bringing groundbreaking new products to the markets”.
He said its innovative manufacturing was responsible for driving business growth and bringing new capabilities to its customers.
Other companies to benefit from the grant include Tindo Operations, which will receive $1m towards a proposed $5.3m solar facility at Mawson Lakes.
Bickford’s Australia, at Salisbury South, will also get $1m to help install an automated bottling line that would have the capability to package hand sanitiser on a large scale. Mr Porter said the country’s manufacturing sector employed 900,000 people and generated almost $120bn in export earnings last year. “Investing in the latest manufacturing technology and equipment ensures they can remain internationally competitive by improving their productivity and increasing their capacity to target new export markets for their products,” he said.
