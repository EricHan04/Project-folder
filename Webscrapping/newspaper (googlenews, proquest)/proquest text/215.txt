THEY have entertained kids since the 1950s, and now slot cars are sparking bright ideas on a whole new scale.
Northern suburbs school students yesterday rose to the challenge to improve the speed and economy of a Scalextric version of Holden's Cruze.
Concept2Creation project officer and former Holden engineering manager Ron Stevens said the real aim was to give students an appreciation of manufacturing.
"It's to show them `if you're interested in engineering, this is what you can do with it'," he said.
The students raced their modified vehicles at the Concept2
Creation Expo, run by the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group, at Golden Grove Arts Centre.
Endeavour College Year 9 student, Emma Kohlberger, 14, who led the winning team, said the program was a great experience.
"I've never really been into tech but this was really interesting," she said.
Team-mate Cameron Alves said the team spent eight weeks perfecting the car and construction process, replacing the original chassis with lightweight plastic, smoothing the wheels and using assembly aids to make the process faster.
