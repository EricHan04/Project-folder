A DECORATED Border Force Assistant Commissioner has resigned from his position while facing an investigation into claims of an inappropriate relationship with a female staff member.
Highly experienced Australian Border Force Capability Division Assistant Commissioner Peter Docwra had been on leave before he quit yesterday. The explosive revelations come with Mr Docwra’s boss Roman Quaedvlieg on leave while investigators probe his alleged relationship with a much younger staff member.
It is understood the investigation into Mr Docwra relates to a relationship with a staff member with whom he had regular contact.
It is likely the probe into Mr Docwra will continue, despite­ him leaving on his own terms.
“The department does not comment or confirm whether any matter is, or is not, under investigation,” a spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said.Mr Docwra holds an extremely high security clearance. When he worked for the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet in 2010, he bolstered secure communications between Parliament House’s briefing room and the White House and 10 Downing St.
