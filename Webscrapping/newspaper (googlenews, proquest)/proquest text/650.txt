ADELAIDE medical device maker Signostics has raised $5.4 million with Australian venture capital firms and private investors to launch its palm-sized ultrasound machine in the U.S.
The result takes the total amount raised by the company for its U.S. launch to $15.8 million.
Chief operating officer and co-founder Stewart Bartlett said raising the money via an issue of convertible shares to Sydney-based life sciences investor Brandon Capital Partners and SA's Playford Capital and Terra Rossa Capital, had been difficult in the economic downturn.
"We believe there are opportunities for affordable medical devices to thrive in an environment where health spending is being re-evaluated," he said.
"Although the current global economic environment has created challenges for most companies to raise sufficient capital, investors believe in our innovative approach to providing significantly more affordable ultrasound technology.
"Our products have many applications that are attractive in many different markets and the additional capital we raised will help us grow into our key target segments."
Funding from the three companies also comes with director appointments. Playford's Amanda Heyworth and Brandon's David Fisher will join two other new directors - retired corporate banker Des Masters and Silicon Valley-based medical device industry investor David Shaw - on the company's board.
The new appointments take the board to six, including founders and brothers Stewart and Neil Bartlett.
Signostics was set up in 2005 and launched its first product in the veterinarian market in January.
It gained regulatory approval to enter the human medical device market in the U.S., Europe and Australia in May, and has set up a sales and marketing office in Palo Alto, California.
Mr Bartlett said Signostics competed with other medical device makers in the hand-held ultrasound market but its product was "unique".
