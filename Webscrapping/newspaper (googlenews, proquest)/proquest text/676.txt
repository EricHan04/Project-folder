AFTER a slow start to mergers and acquisitions in South Australia in 2015, an air of unfinished business remains with some deals not completed and economic factors creating a strong pipeline of opportunities into the new year.
The sale of S. Kidman's massive cattle empire was kicked off in April but delays, including the need to allay federal government concerns, have pushed out a speculated $400 million-plus transaction.
The identity of the bidders and value of the bids have not been disclosed but are known to include Chinese interests.
"S. Kidman (deal) is likely to go on for some months," said EY SA managing partner Don Manifold, who is managing the sale.
"The bids are in but we have to work with the (Federal) Government to see if we can have a transaction structure to address their concerns and that process is ongoing "The Treasurer's involvement is rare but I get the reasons. It's a sensitive issue selling 1.3 per cent of Australia in one transaction; it's going to receive a higher degree of scrutiny." In resources, depressed oil prices have led to Beach Energy's $384 million equity buyout of Drillsearch by February 2016 to boost its market capitalisation towards the billion-dollar mark.
The state's largest company, Santos, fought off a $7 billion hostile takeover bid in October by oil royalty-backed entity Scepter Group - a move fronted by former chief executive and current shareholder John Ellice-Flint.
It raised $2.5 billion and sold off assets to ward off other potential hostile bids but oil prices are still headed south, pressuring the business.
In a positive sign for the state though, some transactions stood out for their focus on growth.
The successful listing of Beston Global Food Company was a big win for the agribusiness sector.
EY helped Beston - now valued at close to $140 million and an owner of dairy farms in Australia and part owner of Ferguson Australia, B.-d. Farm Paris Creek and Mori Seafood - list on the Australian Securities Exchange in August.
"It's pleasing to see an innovative agribusiness like them making some strategic quality acquisitions in dairy, aquaculture and meat," Mr Manifold said.
"I would hope in 2016 to see much greater institutional investment from Australian super funds into the Australian agriculture sector.
"Obviously if overseas parties can see the value in it, we can too." Kain Corporate & Commercial acted as advisers to SeaLink, Ferguson Australia, B.-d. Farm Paris Creek and Ahrens, among others, in 2015.
"It was a tale of two states," Kain C+C managing director John Cain said. "The Bestons, SeaLinks and Ahrens are the genuine growth stories that are great to hear.
"On the other hand, though, were businesses, mostly in the private space, that have grown successfully but are now being sold to interstate or overseas buyers.
"Our large capital base is inactive. These investors (super funds and self-managed super funds) are going for passive listed stocks or passive property rather than investing in operating businesses.
"Businesses need to drive a change in this investment mindset." HWL Ebsworth Lawyers partner Jamie Restas said existing economic conditions were forecasting a busy new year. "A few other smaller listed companies that I have spoken to are starting to look for equity buyers or consolidation opportunities," Mr Restas said.
"I know of one SA crowd that is talking about a listing hopefully early next year and if they raise $100 million, they will be doing a lot of transactions," he said.
Another win-win outcome was Allegro's backing of a March management buyout of the Great Southern Rail from Serco for $5 million that had helped enhance the state's tourism offering.
"The new owners have turned that business around with a nice regional experience including longer stopovers and trips that include Maggie Beer's farmshop and Seppelstfield," said Mr Restas, who advised Allegro on the transaction.
Adelaide's Discovery Parks moved ahead as the nation's largest holiday park operator through its $250 million buyout of Aspen Park Property Fund and is also likely to help corner a bigger share of the hospitality dollar.
As will Blue Sky Private Equity's $67 million purchase of a majority stake in the Independent Pub Group in July.
On the private equity front, KKR's stake play into Tonsley-based medical devices company Signostics and Prom-inent Hill copper-gold miner OZ Minerals were noteworthy.
The state's healthcare/ageing sector continued to see consolidation, with Masonic Homes' $76 million divestment of its South Australian retirement village portfolio to Stockland at the end of June a standout.
A few days later, Blue Sky Private Equity and Swiss-headquartered Partners Group paid an undisclosed amount to acquire majority ownership in Adelaide's HPS - Australia's only national outsourced hospital and oncology pharmacy business.
"The industry thematics behind ageing and health are so compelling that there will be a lot of activity in the years to come," Mr Manifold said.
A tough year is predicted for automotive parts companies.
"I can't see any activity in that space - there is no one to buy," Mr Restas said.
Overall, the low-growth, low-inflation environment that is expected to last at least five years will generate more activity in the public and private markets in the years to come, Mr Cain said.
