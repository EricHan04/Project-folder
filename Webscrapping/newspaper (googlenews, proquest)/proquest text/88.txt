ANTHONY Richardson acknowledges he has a "very understanding wife". At any time of the day or night, the Port Broughton resident can be called upon to rush to scene of a car crash to help extract victims, pack and stack sandbags to protect homes from flooding or remove fallen trees from roads.
Mr Richardson, 34, is one of SA's 1600 SES volunteers who responded to an average of 140 incidents a day in 2015-16; 7272 for the year.
The CFS was also kept busy during the last financial year, with its almost 13,400 volunteers attending an average 174 incidents each day - 9047 for the 12 months.
The figures for both organisations rose from the previous year. The SES attended 5236 in 2014-15 and the CFS responded to 8517 jobs that year.
"It's very eye-opening, just how much you're needed," Mr Richardson said. "If a unit wasn't there, what would happen?" Mr Richardson, who works full time at Nyrstar's Port Pirie smelter, gives credit to his wife Beth, who enabled him to join the Port Broughton SES 18 months ago.
"The majority of the call-outs have been at night time (and Beth) looks after the kids.
"When the floods came in (in September) it was pretty demanding - there were a few days in a row where we weren't really home." The couple's children, Emily, 4, Stephanie, 3 and Charlotte, 14 months, were also used to their dad dashing out the door to do his bit.
"Whenever I have to go out, they ask where you're going and I just say 'someone needs Daddy's help'," he said.
"They understand." CFS firefighter Luke Wilden's children Tarquin, 5, and Aurora, 3, think their dad is a bit of a hero.
The 31-year-old Port Broughton resident has been a volunteer firefighter for about 13 years.
He joined up after he and some mates were caught in a bushfire near Norseman, in WA, when he was 18.
The frightening experience inspired Mr Wilden, who had moved from SA to work in the Kalgoorlie mines, to join WA's volunteer fire service.
"Being involved in quite a few major fires when I was younger...I felt a bit helpless in those previous ones. I wanted to join to get proper training on how to fight a fire properly and efficiently," he said.
After moving back to SA in 2007, and now living in Port Broughton with his wife Joelene and two children, he joined the SA CFS.
"You get a sense that you're really helping the community," he said. CFS chief officer Greg Nettleton said volunteers played an invaluable role in protecting property and people.
