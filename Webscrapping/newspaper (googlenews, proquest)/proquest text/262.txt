CitySwitch Slashes Carbon Pollution Across 1 Million sqm of Commercial Fffice Space
Australian organisations have committed to reduce CO2 emissions across more than one million square metres of commercial office space through CitySwitch Green Office, just one year on from the initiative's national expansion.
The CitySwitch initiative helps commercial tenants improve their energy efficiency and reduce harmful CO2 emissions.
Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore MP said that CitySwitch Green Office commits businesses to tangible changes that deliver long-term environmental benefits.
CitySwitch signatories are organisations who are committed to reducing their impact on the environment and leading Australia's business community in the fight against climate change. An added benefit for signatories is saving money by using energy more efficiently.
"If all of Australia's commercial office tenants were to adopt the simple changes involved in CitySwitch Green Office, a saving of 960,000 tonnes of CO2 could be made each year, which is the equivalent of taking 200,000 cars off the road," Ms Moore said.
"This program is a significant step towards tackling the biggest challenge of our time - climate change."
"When CitySwitch went national in 2008, CitySwitch Green Office had a commitment from 56 office tenancies and approximately 600,000 square metres of office space across the Sydney, North Sydney and Parramatta local government areas.h
"This leading energy efficiency initiative has since expanded to Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane, and now applies to more than 1,000,000 square metres in 169 tenancies around the country."
As the program continues to expand its reach to reduce carbon pollution across Australia, it has also been announced that the ACT Government will become an official program partner. Canberra joins the partnership cities of Sydney, North Sydney, Parramatta, Willoughby, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide in delivering real action on climate change.
Organisations that become CitySwitch Green Office signatories commit to achieving an accredited 4 stars or higher National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) Energy tenancy rating.
CitySwitch began as the 3CBDs Greenhouse Initiative in 2005, a joint project of the City of Sydney, North Sydney and Parramatta City Councils, and the NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water.
Administered nationally by the NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water, NABERS Energy star rates the efficiency of buildings and tenancies, with 5 stars representing exceptional greenhouse performance.
