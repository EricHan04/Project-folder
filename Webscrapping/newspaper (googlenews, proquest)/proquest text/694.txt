PLAYFORD Capital has signed three new deals which has pushed the amount of investment it has generated in the state past $50 million.
Playford chief executive Amanda Heyworth said more than $1 million had been committed to three companies in the water, health and information security sectors.
The companies are:
* Waterfind, an online water trading service which enables irrigators to quickly buy, sell and lease their water rights.
* Signostics, which is developing a medical diagnostics device.
* Lync Software, a previous investee which has developed security software to prevent corporate networks from threats posed by removable devices such as USB drives.
Playford is a State-Government supported organisation which invests in early-stage technology companies.
Deputy Premier Kevin Foley last night said Playford's role was to act as a "money magnet", which invested in companies which would attract further co-investment.
"The State Government recognises Playford Capital as a key plank of its strategy to create a vibrant venture capital and private equity market in South Australia"' he said.
"Playford's tagline is kickstart your technology company . . . $50 million is a pretty good kickstart."
Playford has itself invested $7.5 million and helped attract co- investment of a further $47 million to the companies it invested in.
More than 80 per cent of this money has come from private "Angel" investors and venture capital funds.
