ADELAIDE defence scientist Darryn Smart's work on protecting Australian and Afghan troops from roadside bombs has won him a prestigious national Clunies Ross Award.
Mr Smart and his team at the Defence Science Technology Group in Edinburgh spent the past eight years refining force protection systems to block the threat of improvised electronic devices (IEDs).
Their system is hailed as the world's first effective personal protection device light enough to be worn by a soldier.
"The award was for four devices and they provide a protective haze or force field around a person or vehicle that stops insurgents from sending a signal and setting off an IED," Mr Smart said.
The devices had been commercialised with an estimated benefit of $64 million. They were used by Australian troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and also sold to Afghan police and army, with orders of 155,000 units delivered and another 34,000 ordered.
Mr Smart, group leader communications electronic warfare in the cyber and electronics warfare division, said SA companies AXIOM Precision, Associated Electronics Services and Ultra Electronics were partners.
Federal Defence Minister Marise Payne said the annual Clunies Ross Knowledge Commercialisation Award was well deserved, as the devices had "delivered significant operational capability for the benefit of the ADF, Coalition and partner forces"."The rapid development of unique devices under Defence's force protection program has been both timely and life-saving for security forces threatened by IEDs," she said.
