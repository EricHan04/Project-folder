ADELAIDE teenager Imogen Walters is doing a happy dance after taking another en-pointe step towards her lifelong dream of becoming a professional ballerina.
The 14-year-old has been awarded the inaugural Burnside Village Foundation grant, which supports those who achieve excellence in the arts, community and education.
Imogen, who is moving to Moscow later this year after being accepted into a 10-month training program with the prestigious Bolshoi Ballet Academy, will use the grant to attend its summer school in New York in July.
Enrolment for the three-week summer school, in which Imogen also took part last year, is by invitation only.
"My dream is to become the first Australian dancer for the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow . . . I just love their style of dance," she said. "I want to inspire other youth to chase their dreams and believe that anything is possible." Imogen, who turns 15 in July, is hoping to study fulltime at the academy next year.
The Burnside Village Foundation was created in honour of Richard Cohen, the late founder of the shopping centre. "My husband and I spent our entire lives building Burnside Village and we've always admired the arts and education industries," Burnside Village president Patricia Cohen said.
Meanwhile,The AdvertiserFoundation's next gala luncheon, on May 31, will include a performance by two principal dancers from The Australian Ballet of a pas de deux from Stephen Baynes' Swan Lake. Funds raised will assist the The Australian Ballet 's efforts to engage young people in the arts.TO BOOK, CALL ANGELA CONDOUS ON 8206 2344 OR EMAIL ANGELA.CONDOUS@NEWS.COM.AU
