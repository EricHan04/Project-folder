FORMER West Coast Eagles utility Trent Cummings is set to launch a four-pronged $1 million damages claim over a career-ending knee injury.
Cummings will also take on the Supreme Court in a bid to replicate a South Australian ruling that allows injured players access to WorkCover compensation.
The lawsuit will be lodged against the Eagles, Subiaco Council, the AFL and the Western Australian Football Commission.
He will argue Subiaco Oval was an unsafe working environment when, at 24, he seriously injured his left knee in February 1998. Cummings, 29, is also seeking $29,750 he claims the Eagles owe him in match payments and $2000 in unpaid medical bills.
High-profile sports lawyer Greg Griffin believes Cummings has grounds to sue and is prepared to represent him.
"I think he has a very, very good case and it certainly justifies action," Griffin said.
Griffin headed the legal team that two weeks ago successfully fought for the right of South Australian players to have WorkCover.
He is also representing former Adelaide and Hawthorn ruckman Shaun Rehn, who is suing the Crows after sustaining a knee injury at Football Park in 1999.
Cummings went to the Eagles in 1997 after playing 27 games in three years with Fitzroy.
He wore the Eagles jumper just twice at AFL level before snapping his left anterior cruciate ligament in a practice match against Fremantle in February 1998.
The AFL has declined to comment.
