THE flight from Labor to Liberal-aligned lobbyists has picked up pace following the state election with former Labor pollies bearing the brunt.
In the most recent filings on the State Government register of lobbyists, former State Transport Minister Patrick Conlon has dropped nine clients from his docket, including rail company Genesee & Wyoming Australia and prominent development company Commercial & General.
Conlon retains four clients, including Bombardier Transportation Australia, which he awarded a $269 million deal to in March 2011. Conlon said four of the former clients were the same company, C&G was related to their former old Royal Adelaide Hospital project which had run its course.
Former Senator Chris Schacht dropped five clients including Leigh Creek Energy, which was picked up by former Liberal leader Iain Evans. Evans added four new clients in total, including new ferry operator Kangaroo Island Connect.
Former Liberal deputy premier Graham Ingerson now represents Walker Corporation, which has been trying to get its Riverbank precinct across the line for years.
Former Labor Senator Nick Bolkus has previously lobbied on Walker’s behalf and Conlon also still lists Walker as a client. Bolkus removed engineering company Fyfe, SSE Australia and Bedford Group from his register.
Capetal Advisory, run by Nathan Paine and Matt Clemow, lodged an update three days after the election, retaining their long client list and adding in Statewide Super. But Clemow officially left the business this week. The former Labor staffer said it was unrelated to the election result and he wanted to do “more not for profit and social and affordable housing’’. The move takes Clemow off the lobbyist register but he and Paine will still work together on some projects.Tesla Motors Australia, has employed a spruiker in MMJ Consulting, AKA Melissa Cheesman.
