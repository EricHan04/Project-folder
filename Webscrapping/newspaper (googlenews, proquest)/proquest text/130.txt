WASHINGTON: Actor Matthew McConaughey took the podium in the media room at the White House to deliver an emotional appeal for “gun responsibility”, following the massacre at an elementary school in his hometown of Uvalde, Texas.
“We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before, a window where it seems like real change, real change can happen,” the 52-year-old McConaughey told reporters.
McConaughey, who visited Uvalde and met with families of the victims after 19 children and two teachers were shot dead on May 24, spoke powerfully about some of the children who died.
He displayed a colourful drawing made by Alithia Ramirez, a 10-year-old who had wanted to attend art school in Paris one day.
He also pointed out a pair of green Converse shoes held by his wife, Camila Alves, that belonged to another of the victims, Maite Rodriguez. “Green Converse with a heart on the right toe,” McConaughey said. “These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting.
“How about that?” he said, pounding the lectern in a hushed White House briefing room.
McConaughey, who met with Joe Biden and members of congress before addressing the White House press corps, said the families of the victims had told him that they wanted to make “their loss matter”.
“They want their children’s dreams to live on,” he said.
McConaughey, who has flirted with the idea of running for governor of Texas, said it should be a “nonpartisan issue”.
“As divided as our country is, the gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on,” he said. US gun violence has killed more than 18,000 people so far this year alone.
