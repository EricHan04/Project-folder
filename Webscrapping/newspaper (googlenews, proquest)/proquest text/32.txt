THIS weekend's Division 1 baseball championship playoff will be unknown territory for the Adelaide Angels - they have not contested a season finale for more than 40 years.
But the long wait will not dilute Adelaide's chances of claiming its first title since 1960 after staging tight battles with grand final rival Goodwood all summer.
Goodwood holds the edge 2-1 in their home-and-away clashes and the two teams did not meet in the finals series.
The Indians, who finished top this year to the Angels' third, boast an impressive recent record after winning the championship in 2000 and finishing runner-up to Glenelg last year.
Their pitching combination of firebrand Darren Fidge and catcher Ben Wigmore were named in the All-Star team at the league's presentation dinner this week while Adelaide pitcher/hitter Ryan Simunsen picked up the Caps Medal as the player of the year.
Adelaide coach Darren White was named in the All-Star team as the designated hitter.
The final showdown is a best-of-three series with the first game tomorrow at 2pm, the second at 11.30am on Sunday and the third, if necessary, to start 30 minutes after the end of game two.
