ADELAIDE 3D printing software specialist Makers Empire has signed a new distribution deal to get its program into schools in South Korea.
Korean distributor Greencomm will sell Makers Empire's Learning Program to the Korean education market, where the Government has identified 3D printing as a growth engine for the country.
Makers Empire, based at the UniSA Centre for Business Growth on North Tce, develops programs to help teachers in primary and middle schools teach 3D printer skills.
South Korea was well advanced in its goal of becoming a world leader in 3D printing, said Makers Empire chief executive Jon Soong. "A key objective (is) to achieve 3D printing skills in 20 per cent of the country's population by 2020," he said.
The Korean Government is supplying 5800 3D printers to all schools, training 13,000 teachers and building 130 3D printing promotion centres as part of the initiative, he said.
A number of schools in Australia, Hong Kong and the North Carolina State University in the US are listed as Makers Empire software users on the company's website.
