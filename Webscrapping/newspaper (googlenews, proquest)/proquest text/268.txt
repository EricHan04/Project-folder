ENWAVE Energy has been chosen to deliver one of the country’s largest rooftop solar arrays at the Tonsley Innovation District.
The so-called district energy scheme will draw on about 20,000 solar photovoltaic panels installed on 8ha of roofing over the main assembly building (MAB) and the TAFE SA building.
A total installed capacity of up to 6MW will provide power for Tonsley businesses, residents and other organisations in the precinct.
Enwave will build, own and operate the energy facility after operating similar district energy services at Sydney Central Park and Sydney Airport.
Enwave chief executive Cameron Evans said the company would invest close to $40 million over 50 years for battery storage, photovoltaics, smart technologies and other MAB assets.
“Our bespoke solutions are cost and resource-efficient and, because we aren’t encumbered by legacy systems, we pursue all forms of proven technology to deliver the best outcomes possible,” he said.
Enwave will employ five staff to oversee the scheme and will subcontract SIMEC ZEN Energy to install and maintain the solar panels infrastructure.
Renewal SA general manager property Mark Devine said the district energy scheme would supply businesses and organisations at Tonsley with a reliable, competitively priced and secure electricity supply.
“Initially, the scheme will include access to electricity and recycled water services for the entire Tonsley community, and gas and domestic hot water services for the residential community only,” he said.
“There are also plans to expand the scheme to include a thermal network for the entire site for building space heating and cooling requirements.”Businesses at Tonsley can buy their electricity from Enwave or from another energy retailer.
