AS the world races for a vaccine for coronavirus, a South Australian company will start human clinical trials of a new vaccine against another deadly microbe that causes pneumococcal diseases, blamed for two million deaths a year globally.
GPN Vaccines will run the trials thanks to a $1 million State Government grant. It hopes to significantly improve on the existing vaccine, which is free for babies and high-risk groups under the National Immunisation Program.
The company is using groundbreaking research at the University of Adelaide led by Professor James Paton, SA’s Scientist of the Year in 2017.
Prof Paton, pictured, said pneumococcus was the biggest bacterial killer on the planet.
“Globally, the pneumococcus accounts for about two million deaths a year,” he said.
It is one of six local start-ups to share in $2.75 million to commercialise their products through the state’s Research Commercialisation and Start-up Fund, which is expected to generate more than 130 jobs.
Innovation and Skills Minister David Pisoni said the funding would unlock investment in research in SA.
“Pneumococcal diseases kill more children every year than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined,” he said.
The other recipients are: PING Services – $100,000 to complete its wind turbine monitoring device; THE Village Foundation – $50,000 for an app to support mothers returning to work; TEAMGAGE – $350,000 to develop software; CARINA Biotech – $750,000 to develop its CAR-T cell immunotherapy, and;FUSETEC – $500,000 for 3D printed medical training devices of human anatomy.
