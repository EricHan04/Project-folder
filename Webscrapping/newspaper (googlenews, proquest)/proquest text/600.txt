CREATING opportunities for youth in South Australia is what drives investment analyst Alexandra Grigg, who was recently named Young Leader of the Year at the Women in ­Finance awards.
A senior portfolio analyst for the SA Venture Capital Fund, managed by Artesian, Ms Grigg is also a passionate advocate of the state’s ability to retain and support talent by creating access for start-ups and investors.
“As a sixth-generation South Australian, I want to create local opportunities,” she said. “My friends left after ­university, but I didn’t want to leave to pursue a career ­elsewhere. My family has been in the Adelaide Hills for a long time.” The former investment analyst with Blue Sky and Duxton Capital said she was focused on commercialising great ideas and building connections in her role with SAVCF.
“For me it’s about recreating the venture capital space in SA and explaining and educating money managers to invest in different asset classes,” she said.
She said the award gave her “credibility” to achieve the outcomes she wanted within the industry. The Women in Finance awards program, supported by AMP Bank, is a national initiative to recognise the strength, diversity and innovative leadership within the broader professional and ­financial services industry.
