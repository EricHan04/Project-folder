GOODWOOD jumped out of the blocks and scored four runs by the third inning allowing only two to Glenelg and that is how it finished with a 4-2 victory.
Darren Fidge was yet again the star of the show for the Indians pitching four solid innings being relieved by a returning John Challinor.
Challinor showed he has not slowed after having the last season off and pitching four near perfect innings.
There was a combined 29 strike outs for the game which shows the class of all the pitching with Glenelg's Tristan Stevens and Jay Ziersch both pitching very well.
Glenelg will be encouraged by the form of Korean recruit Jae Jang after he connected for a home run off Fidge and threw a runner out.
Ben Wigmore was the main offensive threat for Goodwood in his return game after three seasons at Kensington.
Meanwhile, the Adelaide Angels are back in business with a resounding 14-5 victory over an undermanned Northern Districts outfit. In his return game Matt Pace connected for five hits to open his account and lead the Angel charge. New recruit Justin Ellery pitching six string innings to allow his hitters some freedom and bang on double digit runs. Returning coach Darren White was excited about the form of his young guns with Ben Frick also collecting three hits and the expected return of Rookie of the Year from last season Justin Roe.
