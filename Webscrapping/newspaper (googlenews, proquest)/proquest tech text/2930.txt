ADELAIDE-based aerial mapping company Aerometrex has reported a small loss in its first year as an ASX-listed company.
Revenue was up 24.7 per cent to $20.1m in the 12 months to June, bolstered by growth in the company’s LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) division, 3D digital models business and MetroMap subscriptions. However, one-off costs associated with the company’s public listing, and other expenditure increases, resulted in a $266,000 loss, down from a $2.6m profit in the previous year.
Aerometrex managing director Mark Deuter said he was pleased with the performance in light of the “general disruption caused to the world-wide economy by COVID-19”.
“While COVID has presented some difficulties, it has also presented opportunities,” he said.
“We intend to capitalise on those opportunities so that we are very well positioned to take advantage of a general economic upturn.” Aerometrex said the continued growth of the MetroMap aerial imagery data service was a priority in the current financial year, as was the development of overseas revenue streams, particularly in the US and Europe.
“Additionally, Aerometrex is assessing potential merger and acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis that would align with the company’s product offering and complement the global strategy of Aerometrex going forward.” The company had $22.2m in cash at the end of June.
