An AI â€˜Time Machineâ€™ and a health lab on wheels â€“ Northeast Arnhem Land, NT
Chronic diseases â€“ such as diabetes and heart disease â€“ cause suffering for thousands of Australians, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous.
The Menzies School of Health Research is letting people experience the effects of long-term diseases before they get sick. HealthLAB â€“ a clinic on wheels â€“ lets people see heart and kidney ultrasounds, hear their heart beating, and try on â€˜alcohol gogglesâ€™ that mimic raised blood alcohol levels. An award-winning interactive Time Machine app completes the picture â€“ literally â€“ by showing how those choices affect appearance.
HealthLAB will travel to locations around Darwin and Northeast Arnhem Land, giving locals the opportunity to talk to a range of scientists and health professionals about the science behind the inner workings of the human body, the technology behind the equipment we use, and exciting future careers in science.
