When a shearing shortage hit South Australia in the 1980s, a man from the Mid North had a different way of solving it.
On display at the Sheep's Back Museum is a special part of South Australia's shearing history - a robotic shearer, built by Lance Lines as the solution to a shearers' shortage.
During the early 1980s, a wool subsidy meant sheep graziers were making good money, and there were large amounts of sheep, but there was no one to shear them.
In response, the Wool Corporation put the money into building to two robotic shearers, to reduce the number of people needed in shearing and reduce the skill level necessary. Yet when the wool subsidy was removed and the price of wool crashed in 1988, the machine was decommissioned and sold to the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, which has lent it to Sheep's Back Museum.
You can see the robotic shearer at the Museum, located on the corner Macdonnell and Cameron streets, seven days a week.
