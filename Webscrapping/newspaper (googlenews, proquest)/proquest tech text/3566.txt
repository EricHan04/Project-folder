FANCY test-driving and buying a car from the comfort of your living room? The concept may seem far fetched, but carmakers are rapidly moving towards a showroom-free business model, cashing in on the COVID-inspired popularity of online sales.
An increasing number of brands have introduced tech that allows motorists to simulate virtual test drives at home using augmented reality.
Volks­wagen has announced the introduction of tech that creates a virtual dealership in the buyer’s living room, allowing them to digitally kick the tyres on the brand’s new T-Cross (pictured) and T-Roc SUVs.
Buyers can get a full 360 degree view of the car and can closely inspect the cabin area.
Users can also turn on the lights, get a feel for the interior features, take an audio tour, as well as see how the car looks in different colours. Volkswagen’s marketing officer, Jason Bradshaw, said: “The launch of Volkswagen’s smallest dealership and AR experience is all about making buying a car online easier and more convenient so Aussies can find, test out and then customise the perfect car for them.”
