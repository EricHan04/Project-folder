There is so much going on around South Australia - and each week we will bring you an array of news, faces and features which will highlight some of the most interesting characters and events we have in our communities.
In this week's stories read about the pearls of wisdom which have come from some of the state's youngest residents while another highlights some interesting behaviour from a group of our older citizens. The old adage 'children should be seen and not heard' went out the window years ago thank goodness, as they teach the older generations a thing or two when it comes to inclusivity, tolerance and kindness. Read the articles below to discover some of the ways young people are creatively learning and changing lives.
And, don't forget to discover what's happening around South Australia over the next couple of weeks.
Enjoy the read.
