A NEAR doubling of the gross value of the state’s creative industries, to $2.1bn, is the cornerstone of a State Government strategy to tap the sector for strong post-COVID growth.
The Creative Industries Strategy, released yesterday, is one of the nine sectors targeted in the government’s Growth State initiative.
Consultation with 500 people within creative industries, which includes screen, music, performing arts, festivals and craft, culminated with a goal to grow the sector by five per cent a year over the next decade. It will seek to use our competitive advantage around safety and costs, alongside our growing expertise in fields such as virtual and augmented reality, to attract business to the state.
“In addition to the vibrancy and cultural value that the creative industries contribute, the sector brings enormous economic value to our state, with South Australian creative businesses directly contributing $1.2bn to the local economy,” Innovation and Skills Minister David Pisoni said.
“Achieving the target of five per cent growth per annum will see the gross value added for the sector nearly double, to $2.1bn by 2030.” Trade Minister Stephen Patterson said: “The creative industries’ impressive capability – including virtual reality and augmented reality – is of significant importance to other key growth sectors.”
