MOBILITY GLOBAL transportation robotics outfit Superpedestrian is bringing its advanced fleet of e-scooters to Australia, and chief executive Assaf Biderman is confident that, unlike a litany of bike-sharing programs before it, its vehicles won’t end up in the river.
The Boston-based company, which began life as a spin-out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has now rolled out its LINK e-scooter sharing program to 30 cities globally, and is zooming into Australia next. Its scooters, accessed through a smartphone app, will be racing across numerous local cities and regional towns before the end of the year.
“Demand for transportation is exploding worldwide,” Mr Biderman said in an interview. ”Vehicles are going to have to shrink, because there is limited space on our roads and demand is only going up. Our vehicles today are 80 per cent empty space, and we need to make them smaller so we can move more people.” Superpedestrian has spent eight years on research and development, building what its CEO described as the first and only comprehensive software operating system for a vehicle. That‘s its “special sauce”, according to Mr Biderman, with the software performing 1000 health checks every second during the electric scooter’s rides.
The company’s LINK scooters last about 100km between charges. Superpedestrian’s scooters will be launching first across Melbourne and regional Victoria, Rockhampton, Adelaide, the Gold Coast, Launceston and Hobart, with more cities to come. The company is adamant it won‘t suffer the same fate as the likes of oBike and ReddyGo, whose bikes were strewn in rivers and in trees, before their parent companies were forced to exit the Australian market.
