"This vehicle was built for the 2017 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge: a 3200-kilometre race from Darwin to Adelaide: which we finished sixth in," Mr Nadalini said.
"We competed in the American Solar Challenge the next year and ended up winning it, beating the University of Michigan's 18-year winning streak."
