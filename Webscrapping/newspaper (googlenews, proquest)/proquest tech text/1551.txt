The topic of agtech and what it could do for the industry was front and centre at the AdvanceAg conference in Adelaide earlier this month.
Hosted by PIRSA and sponsored by a range of industry bodies,the event attracted a sell-out audience of 500 people - 200 more than last year's event.
The common themes across the event included adoption of agtech by producers, and how start-up agtech solutions can better serve their industry in making grower problems the core of the conception of their product.
Included in the two-day event was a competition where five agtech companies were able to specifically pitch to the audience about new innovations, for the chance to win $10,000.
