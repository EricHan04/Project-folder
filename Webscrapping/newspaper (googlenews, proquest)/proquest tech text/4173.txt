I WANT TO BE A CHEESEMAKER
Paul Connolly, master cheesemaker at Beston Global Foods
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO BECOME A CHEESEMAKER?
Firstly, cheese is one of my favourite foods. However, I was working in the milk treatment part of the factory (preparing milk for cheesemakers). I wanted to expand my skills and learn how to be a cheesemaker. Being a cheesemaker gave me more opportunities to learn other jobs like cheese grading and team leader roles.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE THING ABOUT YOUR JOB?
Working with a great team of people at Beston Global Foods. I really enjoy the science, technology and being involved with developing new products. I get to do some cool stuff setting up machines with robotics and computer systems.
WHAT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING ABOUT YOUR JOB?
Setting up new machines and recipes. Getting all the new equipment to work together and start at the right time can be challenging. After some long days and when everything is working well, it is very rewarding.
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO KIDS WHO WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS? Cheesemakers have a good understanding of science, technology and mechanics. If you want to be a good cheesemaker, these are good subjects to learn at school. Food technology or dairy technology are good subjects to learn at TAFE. A factory tour is also a great way of learning more about cheesemaking – if you hear that one is going to take place, get the OK from your parents and school and join the tour. Or, if there’s enough interest, why not ask your school to arrange a tour with us?
WHAT IS THE MOST MEMORABLE THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU AT WORK?Travelling overseas three times in one year to purchase new equipment for our mozzarella plant.
