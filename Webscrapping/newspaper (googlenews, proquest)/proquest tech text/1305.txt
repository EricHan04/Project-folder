SCIENTISTS warn that without good biosecurity measures “alien organisms” on Earth may become a reality stranger than fiction.
Published in the international journal BioSciences, a team of scientists, including Phill Cassey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Adelaide, are calling for greater recognition of the biosecurity risks ahead of the space industry.
“In addition to government-led space missions, the arrival of private companies such as SpaceX has meant there are now more players in space exploration than ever before,” Dr Cassey said.
“We need to take action now to mitigate those risks.” Space biosecurity concerns itself with both the transfer of organisms from Earth to space (forward contamination) and vice-versa (backward contamination). While the research points out that at present the risk of alien organisms surviving the journey is low, it’s not impossible.
