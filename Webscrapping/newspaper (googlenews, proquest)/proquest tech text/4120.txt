THE fight against motor neurone disease comes to Adelaide tonight, and Crows and Richmond fans are being urged to buy the iconic blue and white beanie for the big clash at Adelaide Oval.
Four days after another hugely successful “Big Freeze” at the MCG on Monday, the FightMND foundation is hoping SA footy fans can dig deep to help support vital research into helping find a cure.
With no effective treatment and no cure, the average life expectancy from diagnosis of MND to death is 27 months.
Since inception in 2014, FightMND has invested $28.8 million into world-class medical research and has committed funding to a clinical trial called TEALS (Tecfidera in ALS/MND). The drug Tecfidera is used in trials to try to reduce the inflammation in the brain and spinal cords of patients diagnosed with MND.
The cause is close to the heart of Crows coach Don Pyke, who lost his father Frank to MND just 16 weeks after he was diagnosed in 2011.
Pyke took time last week to meet with Crows supporter Mark Lockwood, 51, who was diagnosed with MND in 2015 and began the TEALS trials in Adelaide last year.
In March, FightMND also announced $320,000 in funding to Flinders University in SA to buy cutting-edge robotics to fast-track the assessment of MND biomarkers in patient samples, which help to track the disease’s progression.
“There has never been greater global momentum and progress in MND medical research as there is right now,” FightMND chief executive Jamie Howden said.
“The support and contribution from the Australian public has enabled us to commit vital funds to world’s best-practice research domestically and internationally.
“Researchers are now able to access tomorrow’s technology today and fundraising events like the Big Freeze significantly contributes to that.”As well as buying a FightMND beanie at the footy for $20 tonight, people can donate to the cause at www.fightmnd.org.au.
