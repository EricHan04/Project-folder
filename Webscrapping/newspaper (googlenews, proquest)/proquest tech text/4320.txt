Kurri Kurri's ALDI store will close temporarilly, later this month, as the store undergoes a comprehensive upgrade,
The closure will take place from 5pm on Monday February 18 to Friday 1 March.
New features as part of the upgrade include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays, as well as extended energy efficient chillers. There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
Many of the changes have been implemented after extensive store trials and state-wide roll-outs of the new store design in South Australia and Western Australia. A spokesperson for the supermarket chain said that the upgrade would not be reflected in prices at the checkout.
"While we are delighted to be introducing these innovations, we want our customers to know they won't lead to higher prices," the spokesperson said.
While ALDI Kurri Kurri closes temporarily, shoppers can visit ALDI Cessnock at 165-167 Wollombi Rd, Cessnock.
