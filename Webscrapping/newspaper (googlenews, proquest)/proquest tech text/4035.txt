Students from Nicolson Avenue Primary School were given a special preview of Science Alive! at the University of South Australia Whyalla Campus on Wednesday.
Science Alive! is a free hands-on science event presented in partnership with principal sponsor GFG Alliance and major sponsor Santos.
It will be held at UniSA Whyalla on Sunday, September 22 from 10am-3pm and will include SciWorld's Spectacular Science Show, Animals Anonymous Shows, Questacon exhibits, roaming Daleks, robotics workshops and much more.
But before the main event students were given the opportunity to participate in an experiment where they pumped water into plastic rockets to launch them into the air.
Science Alive! Event Director Brian Haddy said the water rocket launching was particularly relevant because of the recent launch of the Australian Space Institute in Adelaide.
"Space will be important for employment in the future, we've got lots of jobs coming up, not just related to space but of course in the renewable energy sector," he said.
"Kids have to be a bit more tech savvy for the jobs of the future. Science Alive! is about engaging people in science, getting kids excited about it, and giving them a sneak peek of future careers.
"We want everyone in Whyalla to be science-literate, to involve themselves in discussions about topics like climate change and better preparing young kids for the jobs of the future."
GFG Alliance Media and Communications Manager Sean Kelly said Science Alive! was important for piquing kids' interest in science careers.
"We've got a lot of opportunities out at the steelworks and the mines where they can pursue careers that have science backgrounds," he said.
Whyalla Mayor Clare McLaughlin said it was really important for students to learn science in a practical way.
"It's a great thing for them to be exposed to," she said.
