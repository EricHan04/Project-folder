TIKTOK, memes, blogs, podcasts and Instagram posts are set to take their place on the national English school curriculum, displacing “stale, old-fashioned” writing tasks.
The federal government has given Deakin University researchers almost $500,000 to explore ways to bring digital writing to the secondary school curriculum.
Rather than analyse Romeo and Juliet in an essay, students of the future may be asked to script and design a TikTok about the play. Lead research Lucinda McKnight said there was a sense of urgency about the need to update the way English is taught in schools and bring the curriculum “kicking and screaming into the 21st century”.
Dr McKnight said the approach did not involve ditching the classics but updating their teaching to involve digital writing opportunities that engaged students and was more relevant to their daily lives.
“This is important for student engagement and behaviour,” Dr McKnight said. “We are anticipating the careers and workforce of the future and digital literacy is important for Australians moving forward.
“We are stuck with stale and old-fashioned formulaic essays such as those written for NAPLAN which have no audience and no purpose.” Dr McKnight’s comments come as students around the country are in the middle of ­NAPLAN testing.
She said students “could make a TikTok lesson featuring characters from Romeo and Juliet drawing on their knowledge and insight”.
“Or they could do a virtual reality script for a tour of the Shrine of Remembrance or create a personal profile for a professional networking site,” Dr McKnight said.
“And instead of writing a newspaper article, they could write a news blog or a podcast about the AFL or an Instagram post.” Dr McKnight said students would still be required to stick to the same standards of grammar, spelling, paragraphing and sentence structure while producing content for these digital platforms.
