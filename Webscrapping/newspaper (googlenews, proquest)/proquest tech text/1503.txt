There was plenty of positivity about the future of Australia's agricultural industry last night, as established professionals and students came together for the sixth annual Growing the Future.
Organised by the Adelaide University Agricultural Students Union, the dinner at the Adelaide Oval was described as a "careers night with a difference" by AUASA president James Easter.
The crowd was made up by representatives of some of the big - and small - industry players, as well as school and tertiary students interested in an career within the ag sector.
In her address, Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister Clare Scriven asked for the students in the room to stand up to indicate if they were from a traditional agricultural background before considering their studies.
"Agriculture is one of the most important industries in our state," she said.
"So a lot is riding on you as the future."

"It is far less likely that someone will pursue a career in ag if they don't come from that background," she said.
"We need to harness the different pathways people are coming from, so we can replicate them."
As well as networking, the evening also included a panel that discussed what the future of the industry is going to look like and the importance of agtech.
