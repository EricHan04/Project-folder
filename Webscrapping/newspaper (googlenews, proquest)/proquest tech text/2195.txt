RESOURCES OIL and gas giant BP has made one of its biggest bets on producing green hydrogen after buying into Western Australia’s $US36bn ($52bn) Asian Renewable Energy Hub.
BP has confirmed it will take a 40.5 per cent stake in the project and become its operator with existing partners including Intercontinental Energy, Macquarie and CWP Global.
The energy player, which owns stakes in both the North West Shelf and Browse gas projects in WA, wants to control 10 per cent of global hydrogen markets as part of its long-term goals.
The 26 gigawatt – equal to a third of all electricity generated in Australia – Pilbara project is one of the biggest hydrogen and renewable energy projects under planning in the world. The 6500sq km site will cover an area 10 times the size of Singapore. It is planned that the project will eventually produce 1.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually, or 9 million tonnes of green ammonia, putting it on course to become one of the largest global developments of its kind.
