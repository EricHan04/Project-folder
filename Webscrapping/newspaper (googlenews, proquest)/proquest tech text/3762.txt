THE boss of Amazon’s operations in Australia says it expects belt tightening from customers but is yet to see any major changes to spending.
Amazon Australia manager Janet Menzies said the retailer thinks its millions of local customers will look for bargains amid the economic volatility characterised by soaring inflation and tightening household budgets, but are still willing to spend up on key household items.
“I think that what we know from our customers is that now more than ever, they are looking for good value,” she said. “Everyone is talking about their mortgage, about petrol prices and around whether they should be tightening their belts.
“I think that’s on every single customer’s mind and we are super mindful of that and that the Amazon model is really, I think, pretty well positioned to help customers during times like this.” Amazon’s major global shopping event, Prime Day, will kick off at midnight on July 12. Last year globally Prime Day generated sales of just over $US11bn ($15.7bn) for the US retail giant, up more than 6 per cent on 2020. But Ms Menzies said the retailer was confident the event would be well received by Australian consumers citing its large selection of items, competitive pricing and fast delivery.
She said Amazon in Australia was “so much better than it used to be” with more than 200 million products available. Amazon Australia has more than doubled its operational footprint in 2022 with the launch of its first robotics fulfilment centre in Sydney earlier this year. Latest accounts lodged by Amazon’s Australian operations show that Amazon Commercial Services, the local arm of the Amazon business, hit sales of $1.755bn for calendar 2021 against sales of $1.12bn in 2020, a gain of 57 per cent.
