ROBOTS and hi-tech mining technology developed by South Australia’s space industry could support NASA’s new mission to return to the Moon in 2024.
As revealed in the Sunday Mail, the Federal Government will invest $150 million over five years for the Australian Space Agency to ensure Australian businesses form part of the supply chain to help NASA’s missions. Premier Steven Marshall said the “incredible” development meant more jobs for the state. “This is just really going to turbocharge that investment here into our state because SA is the home of the Australian Space Agency,” Mr Marshall said “We’re already seeing a huge increased level of international interest in SA, from US firms and firms around the rest of the world.” He said Australian-made products that could assist the lunar project include mining technology and robotics.
Industry Minister Karen Andrews said the space agency will start talks with NASA about Australia’s capability, automation, and the health sciences. “SA will play a huge part,” Ms Andrews said.“Space Agency is headquartered there, mission control is being set up there, and the Space Discovery Centre is also happening in Adelaide, so there’s lots of things for Adelaide and South Australia.”
