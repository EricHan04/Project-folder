GLOBAL software company TeamViewer has unveiled its new Australian headquarters in Westpac House on King William St.
The company, which operates a digital platform that can remotely access, control and repair IT and other devices, has relocated about 100 employees to its new HQ following 10 years of operating in the Australian market.
About 60 per cent of TeamViewer’s Asia-Pacific team are located in Adelaide, which is home to the company’s Australia and New Zealand regional office.
Its customers in Australia range from government organisations to companies operating in the financial services, mining and utilities sectors.
TeamViewer Australia and New Zealand vice-president of sales Emad Afghani said the new office and the company’s 10-year history of being well established in Adelaide demonstrated its commitment to growth in Australia and the wider region.
“We are one of TeamViewer’s longest existing locations and supported the growth of the company through all the years,” he said.
“We have a firmly embedded culture that is determined to support the evolving technology, service and support requirements of our customers, both in South Australia and across the region.” Starting with remote access and IT support software in 2005, TeamViewer now offers a range of connectivity platforms including augmented reality software for front-line workers in industrial environments. The company is headquartered in Goppingen, in southern Germany, and is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, employing about 1500 people globally.
