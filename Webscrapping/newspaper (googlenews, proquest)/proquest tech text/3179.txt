THREE-dimensional printing is one of the myriad technologies that should help reverse South Australia’s brain drain – and 3D-printed brains are just the beginning.
Adelaide’s Fusetec will brilliantly fill a gap in the market, making brains and other body parts for surgeons to practice on.
It is working in collaboration with the University of Adelaide, the University of South Australia and the Royal Adelaide Hospital to take the replica brains to the world. But this technology, part of what is known as Industry 4.0, has almost limitless applications.
One day, an astronaut on their way to Mars or a submariner on their way to the South China Sea, will run into technical trouble.
They’ll be able to bring an engineer on board with virtual reality to diagnose the issue, and then the engineer will be able to send the data to the spacecraft or submarine so they can print a replacement part.
It’s remarkable, and realistic, and very exciting.
As with Fusetec, the State Government’s job is to stay out of the way, give support where possible, and keep building excitement about the jobs of the future.
