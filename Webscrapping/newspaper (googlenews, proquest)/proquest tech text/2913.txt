GFG confirmed on Thursday it had hired EY to explore options for the sale of part or all of the projects — which are largely approved but still to be built — amid a new rush of interest in renewable projects in South Australia.
This week Canadian renewables company Amp Energy was talking up plans to spend more than $2bn building a renewable energy hub in the state, including hydrogen, with up to 1.3 gigawatts of power.
Amp Energy has bought a portfolio of large-scale integrated solar, wind and battery storage projects, including two — at Robertstown, north of the Barossa Valley, and Bungama, near Port Pirie — expected to begin “staged energisation” in late 2022, about the time Mr Gupta has said Cultana and Playford will enter the market.
Sources suggest GFG may struggle to realise a full valuation for the assets, given the increasingly crowded renewables market, despite the conditional 10-year supply deal signed with the South Australian government that comes into play when they are built at an estimated cost of $660m.
The projects were part of Mr Gupta’s grand design for a “green steel” plant at his Whyalla steelworks, and were to be built and operated by SIMIC Energy, part of Mr Gupta’s now struggling GFG Alliance empire.
The Cultana solar farm would generate up to 280MW of solar energy, on land within the existing steelworks site.
