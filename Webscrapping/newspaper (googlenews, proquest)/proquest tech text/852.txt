Also lining up for the $1.2bn asset is believed to be The Port of Melbourne, which is owned by Queensland Investment Corporation, the Future Fund and Global Infrastructure Partners, Flinders Port and AMP Capital.
Flinders Port in South Australia is owned by Equipsuper, Spirit Super, State Super, Statewide Super and Infrastructure Capital Group.
Palisade already owns the Port of Portland while AMP Capital owns port assets internationally.
The remaining 50 per cent shareholding of Port of Portland, a deep water located between Melbourne and Adelaide, was purchased by Palisade in 2018 from the Utilities Trust of Australia in 2018, giving it full ownership.
At that time, the price paid for the interest equated to about 11 times the port’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation including debt.
First round bids for Geelong Port were due around the first week of August in the contest and it is understood that parties are now appointing investment banks for a potential transaction.
Brookfield, advised by Barrenjoey, owns half the port through its company Linx, while the remainder is owned by State Super, advised by Macquarie Capital.
Brookfield’s interest is on offer, but State Super may also be open to a divestment.
The Geelong Port makes about $60m in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and hopes to sell for about 20 times that.
It is located 75km southwest of Melbourne and comprises 15 berths across two primary precincts, Corio Quay and Lascelles.
It manages more than $7bn of trade and employs 1800 workers, handling more than 10 million tonnes of cargo annually.
The port was previously part of Patrick and the ASX-listed Asciano group of companies before a takeover that took place in 2016.
The mid-tier Australian infrastructure investor Palisade owns other assets such as the Coffs Harbour and Sunshine Coast Airports, hospitals and renewable energy assets such as the Snow Town 2 wind farm.
