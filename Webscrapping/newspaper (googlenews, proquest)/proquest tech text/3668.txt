FIVE emerging technologies are set to transform the state’s manufacturing sector through industry interest groups.
University research leaders will support and guide local businesses that register for interest groups announced at the Disruptive Technologies Seminar in Adelaide yesterday.
Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment David Ridgway said he wanted to leverage the expertise of SA universities and lead researchers.
“The evolution towards Industry 4.0 represents several unique challenges for South Australian businesses, including access to knowledge and independent advice, strategic view of technology, digital maturity and access to the necessary skills,” Mr Ridgway said.
“What we are trying to do with these interest groups is build closer connections between advanced manufacturers and provide a platform for companies to share their experiences and help accelerate the uptake of new technologies.” The five interest groups are robotics and automation; virtual and augmented reality; additive uanufacturing (3D printing); data-driven decision-making; and machine learning.
Director of innovation and transformative technology at Deloitte Australia, Nick Tai, presented the business case for transformation, asking “What are you going to do future-proof your business?” He challenged SA business leaders to consider new business models, new processes and new markets.
“How do you take advantage of these technologies to rethink what your business looks like and even what your industry looks like over the next ten to 20 years?” he said.SA COMPANIES AND RESEARCHERS CAN JOIN FREE AT DTTI.SA.GOV.AU/INDUSTRY/
