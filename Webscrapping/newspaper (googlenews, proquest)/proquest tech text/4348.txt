TECH-SAVVINESS has guided a brewer in the Port Adelaide region to weather the storm of COVID-19.
The team at Big Shed Brewery on Old Port Road, Royal Park, say a fast internet connection – coupled with a heavy social-media presence – has helped them through pandemic.
Big Shed Brewery co-owner Craig Basford said the brewery was on a 50/20 mbps plan that had allowed them to keep the enterprise up to speed.
“It allows us to scale the business much quicker,” Mr Basford said. “We have got the same capability as the biggest brewers.” Mr Basford said every critical element at Big Shed – from accounting, to the brewing management system, point of sale and “even the music” – was run through the internet and into a cloud. “It got us through a lot of hard times during COVID-19,” he said.
“If it didn’t save us, it certainly made it a lot easier. “It allowed us to ramp up our online sales and access customers from all over the world.”
