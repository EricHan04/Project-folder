Angus Botham and Jack Jones from Barker College were two of 16 primary and high school students who travelled to Adelaide in December for the VEX National Robotics Championships.
The competition involved designing and building a robot to win a game-based engineering challenge against 43 other teams.
Barker College teacher David Frazer said he was happy with their progress. “We are so proud of the way the boys represented Barker and achieved such amazing results in our first year in the competition,” Mr Frazer said.“Barker had two teams make the final. Both teams scored 105 points in the final. They finished second overall in Australia. They lost to a team that won last year.”
