Young film buffs from the region are being sought to participate in a film festival taking place in Adelaide later this year. Applications for the Youth Jury program as part of the Adelaide International Youth Film Festival are open.
The program is seeking youths aged between 15 and 25 living in rural and regional South Australia, to join fellow jurors from Adelaide, interstate and overseas in viewing and judging the festival films to award prizes.
Organisers hope that around half the total number of around 40 jurors will be from country areas of South Australia. The regional jurors will travel to and stay in Adelaide for the duration of the festival with support from the Coca Cola Foundation.
Alongside screenings of films for young people aged five to 25, the festival will include hands-on workshops on elements of filmmaking such as virtual reality and special effects makeup and Q&As with up and coming local filmmakers.
The festival runs from 17-21 September at Hoyts Cinemas, Norwood. Youth Jury applications close on July 10. Visit https://www.aiyff.com.au/youth-jury/ to apply.
The program for this year's festival was unveiled on Friday, June 21, at Norwood Town Hall.
