MOUNT Compass dairyfarmer Nick Brokenshire said there was a lot of reasons why dairy had problems attracting staff, but he still believes there is potential for a great job in the industry.
"It is definitely hard to get people to get up early in the morning to milk cows," he said.
"When you're working with animals, it's very important to find people who like working with animals."
But he says most dairyfarmers worked hard to make sure the farm is an "enjoyable place to work" for their staff, including paying above the award wages.
With staff so difficult to find, he said there was increasing interest in robotic dairies, even on the Fleurieu Peninsula, because of the "headache" in finding staff.
"We're generally looking at ways to be more efficient to reduce labour needs," Mr Brokenshire said.
Robotics were a big investment for a business and were not necessarily a fast pay-off, he said.
But he said the alternative was more pressure and even longer hours on farming families.
