Some of the world's leading young minds dealing with robotics hail from the Southern Highlands. Some St Paul's International College students in Moss Vale have secured a spot to compete in the World Robotics Championships in the USA. The St Paul's team 64834A (SPIC IQ A) was invited to the World Championships after becoming runners-up in the Teamwork competition in Adelaide in December.
This world-class effort is the result of two years of hard work on behalf of students, teachers and parents alike. The team has previously won the Amaze Award at Nationals in Melbourne in 2018. The Year 8 students from team 64834A, who made the latest success a reality include Jack Speerin (who also won volunteer of the year at Nationals in 2019), Henry Corro, Aayush Panta, Hayden Bailey and Brihat Dhital.
The students have been guided and supported on their successful journey by teachers Anton Planting and Amanda Fittler as well as Sr Angelina Fong and Executive Anne-Maree Scott and Andrew Laing, and parents of the students involved.The team and organisers would also like to thank Ben Woods from CEO Wollongong as well as Jessica and Nicole from VEX Australia.
