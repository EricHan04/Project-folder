WE can go to Mars. We want to change the climate. Yet no tech-savvy genius can track and nab the text scammers. Come on. TONY, Ardrossan
FUNNY how the yuppie brigade think renewable energy is modern. We had a freelite wind generator (wind farm) more than 55 years ago. When the wind blew it turned the freelite, which in turn charged the batteries, which powered the house. If the wind didn’t blow you started the other generator. It’s time people woke up that it’s a big con.

WHY would anyone believe what state Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas has to say regarding parliamentary speaker Dan Cregan? I think Cregan should be sacked for furthering his own ego and lack of loyalty.

RESPECTFULLY, it would be a mistake to think gas has any role to play in the path towards zero emissions. Gas produces significant greenhouse-gas emissions and a reason for it to be promoted is for profits. JESSIE MacGILLIVRAY, Ashford
GOOD on Prince William for addressing the elephant in the room. We have too many problems right here on good ol’ mother Earth to be wasting money on space exploration that benefits no one but just inflates the egos of the obscenely rich. GROW UP GUYS
