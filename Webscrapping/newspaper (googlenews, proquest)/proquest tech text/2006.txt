LOCAL manufacturer Tindo Solar has partnered with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to install solar panels on dozens of bank branches across the country.
Close to 50 of the bank’s branches and office properties have had solar panels installed on them, with further installations scheduled between now and the end of the year.
Tindo has installed panels on five east coast properties over the last month alone.
Bendigo and Adelaide Bank managing director Marnie Baker said the partnership with Tindo was part of the company’s commitment to purchase 100 per cent renewable energy by 2025 and to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.
“At the end of the 2020-21 financial year, 30 Bendigo Bank branches across Australia used energy derived from solar power,” she said.
“We now have a total of 49 branch and office locations benefitting from solar panels, with further installations scheduled between now and the end of the year.
“Partnering with local Australian companies such as Tindo aligns with our longstanding purpose of feeding into the prosperity of the community, not off it.” Tindo Solar chief executive Shayne Jaenisch said the partnership with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank supported local jobs and innovation. “Bendigo and Adelaide Bank is supportive of businesses in the renewables industry, and the bank initially financed Tindo Solar’s new $11.5m factory that is currently producing some of the world’s most efficient solar panels,” he said.
