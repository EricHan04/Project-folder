A NEW Agribusiness Australia report shows the agriculture industry is likely to fall short of its aim to be a $100b sector by 2030 – by about $12bn – unless it changes the way it does business.
The State of the Industry report says Australia is losing market share to emerging markets such as South America and the Baltic States.
Agribusiness Australia president and Elders managing director and chief executive Mark Allison said an industry-wide approach was essential, not only on Australia’s farms but across the agribusiness value chain.
“The bottom line is that for every dollar that is created on farm, two are created through the supply chain,” he said.
“That is why we need to clarify, validate and build on the current farmgate target to encompass a $300bn value chain target, driving innovation and efficiency that benefits the entire industry. This will expand on the value achieved by farmers from R&D to the consumers, enhancing logistics and infrastructure, supporting manufacturing and food processing, and driving investment in retail and export markets.” The report recommends industry: CONTINUES to attract new domestic and foreign investment to the most sustainable and high-growth commodities; INVEST intelligently throughout the supply chain to drive a more efficient multiplier effect; EMBRACE environmental, social and government risk identification and management, embedding sustainability into all areas of the agribusiness supply chain, particularly in water stewardship; OPTIMISE the use of agtech to help reverse declining productivity growth; PRIORITISE physical and digital infrastructure investment across transport, logistics and communications; DIVERSIFY market access, harnessing global Free Trade Agreements while finding the right balance between commodities and niche markets, and; FIND and attract a qualified, high-calibre workforce.
Mr Allison suggested a national framework was needed, focusing on agricultural research and development settings, infrastructure investment and the frameworks that will attract capital, particularly from foreign investors. “A rebalanced agricultural Australian research, development and extension system that looks beyond individual commodities to a total value chain approach to investment will also deliver a broader benefit to Australian agriculture,” he said.
