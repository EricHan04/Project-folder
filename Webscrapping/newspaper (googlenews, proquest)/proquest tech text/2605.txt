RENEWABLES accounted for almost 60 per cent of South Australia’s electricity generation in 2020, analysts say.
And the state ended the year with the fourth consecutive month of having the cheapest wholesale price in the national electricity market.
The figures from the Australian Energy Market Operator show SA generators were paid an average $16.78 per megawatt hour in December.
In NSW and Queensland, the states most reliant on black coal power stations, the prices were the highest at $71.38 and $54.46 respectively.
Using the AEMO data, market analyst Geoff Eldridge estimated that SA relied on 59.9 per cent renewables.
Of the generation from renewables, more than 72 per cent was wind-generated and the rest solar.
Gas made up almost all the rest of the state’s generation.
Renewables frequently provided more than 100 per cent of SA’s needs in 2020, with excess exported to Victoria. SA set a global benchmark last year, when the state was powered 100 per cent from solar alone for an hour on Sunday October 11.
