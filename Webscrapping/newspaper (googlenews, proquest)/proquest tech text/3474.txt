TRY BEFORE YOU BUY ... WELL, VISUALLY ANYWAY If you’ve ever attempted to buy a rug online and struggled to imagine how it might look once back at your place, then hot new business Miss Amara is for you.
The all-Australian business elevates the usually daunting experience by offering free styling services by in-house interior experts and a risk-free return policy, but better still the site provides a virtual styling tool that uses augmented reality so that customers can visualise what a rug will look like in their space.
In layman’s terms, customers take a snap of the room where they plan to place the rug and then upload it to the Miss Amara site. They can then place as many digital rugs into the space as they like and get to see the in-situ result in real time.
Founded in 2014 by husband-and-wife duo, Aaron Weller and Alex Tanya Weller, Miss Amara was born after Alex tried, and failed, to purchase a rug online. “After asking family and friends, I realised it was a common occurrence for people to get really inspired, go on Pinterest, and find amazing photos but then reality would hit and the experience was terrible.” Thanks to Miss Amara and its clever tech offering, those days are history.
