WOOLWORTHS Group in SA will switch to 100 per cent renewable energy from July, using solar and wind to power all 70 supermarkets, all 17 BIG W stores and the Adelaide regional distribution centre.
About 100,000MWh of renewable electricity will be sourced from Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park, where Iberdrola Australia has 50 turbines and 250,000 solar panels. That’s enough to power 20,000 homes, or Brighton and Glenelg.
Woolworths Group will use 100 per cent renewable energy nationwide by 2025. “Our customers want us to make shopping better for the planet, and renewable energy is one of the key ways we’re boosting sustainability,” chief executive Brad Banducci said.
Premier Peter Malinauskas congratulated Woolworths Group on making the switch . “This is the way the world is moving,” he said. “Private capital is now leading the charge.”
