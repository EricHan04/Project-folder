If walls could talk, Straun House would tell quite a story.
The iconic mansion located just south of Naracoorte has seen a few different uses over the years since its construction.
Building commenced in 1873 and took two years to be completed. It was built by John Robertson at that time for his retirement.
Mr Robertson had leased the Mosquito Creek run from the government in 1843.
In 1946 the land, and House, was purchased by the government and turned into a "rural colony for the better class delinquent boys and youth."
The school closed in 1970 and was instead repurposed into what it is known as today, the Straun Research Centre.
Owned and maintained by the South Australian Research and Development Institute, the Centre is a hub for emerging agricultural technologies and practices to be trialed.
The nearby Kybybolite Research Centre is an offshoot for Straun and is used for cropping, pasture and sheep grazing trials.
Facilities at Straun included feedlot capacity of up to 200 cattle for nutrition and feedlot research, two centre pivots for irrigation capacity supporting pasture, parasite and other livestock trials, and a TechnoGrazing system under irrigation and dry land conditions to increase pasture use.
In November last year, Elders Rural partnered with the state government to develop best-practice farming demonstration sites in the South East.
It allowed farmers to trial AgTech and latest animal genetics and pasture varieties, plus modern-day water utilisation, disease management and grazing strategies.
Straun also had collaborative contracts with the University of Adelaide, MacKillop Farm Management Group and Grains Research and Development Corporation amongst others.
