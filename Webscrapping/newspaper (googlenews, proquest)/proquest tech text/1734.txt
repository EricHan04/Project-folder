SOUTH Australia’s first AgTech showcase will return next year, following a successful AdvanceAg event at the Adelaide Showgrounds this week.
Primary Industries Minister Tim Whetstone said a sellout crowd of more than 300 registrations showed the importance of creating connections for farmers, businesses and researchers to technology that will grow their productivity and profitability.
“We want to provide the platform for South Australia to be a national leader in AgTech,” he said.
“AgTech presents the biggest opportunity for our $15.2 billion primary industries and agribusiness sectors to transform on-farm practices and achieve efficiencies unlike anything we’ve seen before.” This week’s event featured keynote speakers Dr Astorre Modena, from Israel’s Terra Venture Partners, and Thomas Foods International’s Darren Thomas.AdvanceAg had themes of farm management, remote sensing and IoT devices, and included speakers from Elders and Hummingbird Technology.
