ALISON BRANLEY, REPORTER: At this Sydney workshop, Jason Elias is gearing up for his company's biggest expansion in decades.
JASON ELIAS, PRECISION METAL GROUP: The government's spending money on infrastructure, defence, all these sectors - welding is the key focus.
ALISON BRANLEY: But his plans face one major snag. Jason says his apprentices aren't getting the technical training they need to help him meet his contracts.
JASON ELIAS: Currently, the TAFE curriculum is at least 10 to 15 years old.
ALISON BRANLEY: A former TAFE teacher himself, Jason Elias says it falls to employers to fill the gap.
JASON ELIAS: We have to now set up in-house training facilities. It would take us another 12 months, minimum, to get them up to scratch.
ALISON BRANLEY: Second-year apprentice Brendan says his TAFE course was basic.
BRENDAN, APPRENTICE: I've learnt a lot more here. Theory-wise & practical-wise.
GEOFF CRITTENDEN, WELD AUSTRALIA: I look at the equipment, & it's a bit like stepping back into a museum.
ALISON BRANLEY: Geoff Crittenden represents the welding industry. He argues the curriculum is held back by red tape, claiming apprentices are still required to spend 250 hours on welding techniques that are no longer widely used.
GEOFF CRITTENDEN: It's easier to just use the same material time & time again. We need to look at robotics. Big Data is now a thing in welding.
Internationally, our rugby teams are a lot better than our welding teams, I can tell you that now.
ALISON BRANLEY: The organisation that represents TAFE institutes says it's up to industry to drive changes in technical training.
CRAIG ROBERTSON, TAFE DIRECTOR AUSTRALIA: TAFEs & TAFE teachers have to follow the curriculum & the requirements that are set by industry. So our message to employers is go & talk to your industry association.
ALISON BRANLEY: New figures show Australia has failed its own test when it comes to skills.
Employer satisfaction with training has fallen nearly 10 per cent in the past decade. The proportion of trainees who got a job or promotion from subsidised study also declined.
Federal & state governments have cut spending on vocational training by more than $1.5 billion since 2012. The biggest cuts were in Victoria, South Australia, & WA.
CORRENA HAYTHORPE, AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION UNION: Well, those numbers are raw numbers and, in fact, in real terms, it's significantly more.
ALISON BRANLEY: The federal & state governments will inject an extra $1 billion into the skills sector through the new JobTrainer scheme but some fear that TAFE's share of the money won't make up for years of belt-tightening.
CORRENA HAYTHORPE: The announcement of JobTrainer has been particularly disappointing. The $1 billion of funding announced is less than one-third of the cuts.
GRAEME ELPHINSTONE, ELPHINSTONE WEIGHING SYSTEMS: We design & manufacture log trailers, log transport equipment.
We have auto electricians, a boilermaker welder, fitter & turner.
ALISON BRANLEY: Graeme Elphinstone has been hiring apprentices for four decades, & says he's seen more arrive without even the most basic skills.
GRAEME ELPHINSTONE: They battle to read & write when they come to us, let alone do maths. We have to do a lot more training in-house to get apprentices to where we want them.
CRAIG ROBERTSON: It's well & truly accepted that literacy & numeracy is a general issue across the labour market.
ALISON BRANLEY: TAFE teachers see the need to do more, but say, despite a new literacy program that started in May, the present system isn't tailored for it.
CRAIG ROBERTSON: Now that there is a lot more technology work, you need to have those increased levels of literacy & numeracy & we don't really fund that or put that into training package requirements & nor is it measured, nor is it regulated.
BRAIDEN GARBOWSKI, FITTER AND TURNER: I learned pretty much everything I know about it here on the job.
ALISON BRANLEY: Fitter & turner Braiden Garbowski has just finished a four-year apprenticeship. The high-end lathe he uses at work is a far cry from the one he trained on.
BRAIDEN GARBOWSKI: There's not really a great deal on offer as far as CNC (computer numerically controlled) machining is concerned at TAFE in Tasmania. They've got an old Accouma, probably from the '70s, I'd say.
CORRENA HAYTHORPE: We need to invest in TAFE to make sure that they have the machinery, the plant equipment & the classrooms set for 21st-century learning.
GRAEME ELPHINSTONE: Hey Bray, how are you going with it?
ALISON BRANLEY: Braiden's boss says TAFE staff no longer regularly visit apprentices to help them stay up to date.
GRAEME ELPHINSTONE: Beautiful.
Occasionally, they come & all they really bring is the paperwork, & they just want to tick all the boxes.
ALISON BRANLEY: Even TAFE bosses concede it's time for drastic change. They want to throw out the system that sees rigid national training curriculums written in Canberra.
CRAIG ROBERTSON: It has become very centralised. So there needs to be some autonomy at the local level to train to an industry standard, but to also be able to make sure it can meet what the local employers need.
ALISON BRANLEY: While a Productivity Commission review of the training system is underway, the Government says it's also created a new National Skills Commission.
Minister Michaelia Cash told 7.30 the Government is focused on: "Simplifying the VET system & making sure it's more responsive to the skills required by employers."
Across the skills sector & industry, there's widespread agreement that better vocational training is more crucial than ever.
CRAIG ROBERTSON: Well-funded TAFE is going to be the bedrock of a recovery.
JASON ELIAS: The opportunity in the next five years in, particularly, the defence sector, the sky's the limit.
