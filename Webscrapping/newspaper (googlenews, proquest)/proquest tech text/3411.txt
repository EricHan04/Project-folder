GEELONG High students went crazy for science this week when Science Alive! took over the classroom and educated them like never before.
The lucky Year 7 students got an exciting preview of what’s to be seen at Science Alive!’s upcoming mobile science expo, to be held at GHMBA stadium.
Those attending will be treated to a range of science shows and engaging presentations from young scientists and engineers.
Event director Brian Haddy said the interactive display would allow high school students to experience where a career a science could take them, and that the diverse displays would appeal to both young and senior students.
“The slime-making is always popular for younger visitors, and the virtual reality and infra-red selfies appeal to older age groups,” Mr Haddy said.
This is the first time the expo has been held in Geelong, with a similar event running successfully in Adelaide for 13 years.Students from Geelong schools will visit the expo at GHMBA stadium from May 25-26.
