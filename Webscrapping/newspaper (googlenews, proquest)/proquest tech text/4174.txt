DOCTOR Ian Davis is lovingly remembered as one of the co-founders of FightMND, which has shone a bright spotlight on the devastating motor neurone disease with events such as the AFL’s Big Freeze.
Now, a year after his death from the terminal disease, Flinders University has named a laboratory in his honour to celebrate his achievements in fighting MND. The new Ian Davis Flinders University Biomarker Facility is a fitting tribute to Dr Davis, a Flinders medical graduate, says FightMND chief executive Jamie Howden.
“Ian will forever be remembered for his lasting contribution to MND research in Australia and globally,” Mr Howden said.
“This honour is a deserved acknowledgment of the commitment Ian gave to finding effective treatments and a cure for MND, especially while he was dealing with his own personal battle.
“FightMND thanks Flinders University for bestowing this honour on Ian as recognition of his impact on MND research.” Dr Davis was diagnosed with MND in 2011 when he was just 33. From there, he dedicated his life to finding more effective treatments and, eventually, a cure. Together with AFL legend Neale Daniher, and Pat Cunningham, who lost his wife to MND in 2016, Dr Davis co-founded FightMND in 2014 and was its inaugural chairman.
He courageously fought MND for seven years and died from the disease on November 1 last year.
FightMND last year gave $318,500 to Flinders University to buy state-of-the-art robotics equipment to scale up a biomarker test in urine that can help determine if drugs are working in clinical trials of MND patients.
Head of the MND and neurotrophic research laboratory at Flinders University Dr Mary-Louise Rogers said honouring Dr Davis was a privilege.“Dr Davis provided pivotal support for translation of Flinders University MND biomarker research to use in clinical trials,” Dr Rogers said.
