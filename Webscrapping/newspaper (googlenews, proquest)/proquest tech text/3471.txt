SEVERAL virtual and augmented reality artworks showcasing technology used by Disney and Pixar will be unveiled in the CBD this week.
Herding Caterpillars is a trail linking three sculptures around the city, which visitors interact with through their smartphones.
“This project will be an engaging and educational experience for visitors, and is particularly timely, given it falls directly in the middle of the school holidays,” said Arts Minister Andrea Michaels.
Presented by Butterfly Conservation SA, Flinders University’s The Void and creative producer Rosina Possingham, Herding Caterpillars features the chequered copper butterfly, a recently rediscovered species found in Adelaide’s southern parklands.
The project will kick off with the launch of the 10-day Nature Festival on October 6. The State Library hosts the Herding Caterpillars VR experience from October 14-16, with a 360-degree recording of butterflies and plants, experienced through VR headsets.
