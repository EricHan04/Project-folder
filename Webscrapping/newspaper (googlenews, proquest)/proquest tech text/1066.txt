Queensland will not increase its 2030 emissions reduction target despite its 30 per cent commitment being eclipsed by other east coast states.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has refused calls to bring emissions down 50 per cent, compared with 2005 levels, within the next eight years, despite increased lobbying from conservationists.
It puts the Queensland government – which in 2017 set a target of 30 per cent by 2030 and for net-zero emissions by 2050 – ­behind NSW, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT, which have all committed to reducing emissions at least 45 per cent.
As of 2019, Queensland, which is reliant on coal for power generation and royalties, has only ­reduced emissions about 14 per cent on 2005 levels.
Ms Palaszczuk on Friday appeared to confuse the issue with her government’s 50 per cent ­renewable energy target when asked about the 2030 emissions reduction target. On Monday, a spokesman said the government would not increase the state’s 2030 emissions reduction target, despite NSW and Victoria upping their targets in recent months.
“Queensland is well on its way to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,” the spokesman said. “To date, more than 40 large scale wind and solar farms have been committed to, with nearly $10bn of investment and 7000 jobs.
“The recently announced $2bn Queensland Renewable ­Energy and Hydrogen Jobs Fund means that investment will continue.” Tasmania’s emissions target is the nation’s most ambitious, with the state planning on reaching net-zero emissions by 2030. NSW has a 50 per cent ­reduction target by 2030, Victoria 45-50 per cent, South Australia 50 per cent and the ACT 65-75 per cent below 1990 levels.
