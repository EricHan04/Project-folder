Tuesday, 5 April 2022Celebrating clinical excellence and innovation in Australia's private hospitalsThe Australian Private Hospitals Association (APHA) 2022 Awards For Excellence celebrate successful projects in innovation and clinical excellence by private hospitals around the country.The Awards, announced this evening (Monday 4 April 2022), recognise the amazing work being done in the private hospital sector, said APHA CEO Michael Roff."Australia's private hospitals have a long tradition of innovation and providing high quality health care to their patients. It was the private sector that introduced robotic surgery to this country and the innovation hasn't stopped there," he said."Australians saw private hospitals step up to help the public system cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, and now we have an opportunity to congratulate private hospitals for thinking outside the box to deliver new and effective practices that improve health care outcomes for their patients. This is even more remarkable considering the constraints the pandemic has placed on them."Mr Roff said the high standard of entries for the Awards reflected the great work being done in the private sector, which is constantly striving to improve services."These efforts are particularly noteworthy given COVID pressures that include surgery restrictions, staff shortages, increasing cost pressures and helping public hospitals and aged care with the pandemic response," he said.Mr Roff said all entrants would have been worthy winners and the judges had a difficult task determining the successful hospitals. There was also an element of peer review in the judging - delegates at the APHA 39th National Congress voted on the winners following presentations from each finalist during the event. The delegates vote counted for five percent of the final score.The Awards were presented at the APHA Gala Dinner held in Adelaide Monday 4 April 2022.Clinical Excellence:Winner: Mt Wilga Private Hospital, Lymphoedema Rehabilitation ProgramSynopsis: A multidisciplinary team approach to lymphoedema care that has resulted in reduced requirement for treatment sessions, increased skills across the nursing and exercise physiologist teams and increased communication with patients resulting in the service better meeting their care goals.Finalists:* Brisbane Waters Private Paediatric Jungle Safari Experience* Sydney Adventist Hospital - Nutrition and DieteticsInnovation:Winner: South Pacific Private Hospital - Accreditation to Rainbow Tick StandardsSynopsis: South Pacific Private have implemented six LGBTQIA+ inclusive practice standards to achieve Rainbow Tick Standards in 2021.
