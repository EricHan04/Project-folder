ADVENTURERS can travel back and forth in time to the Antarctic as part of virtual reality experience Thin Ice, which will have its world premiere at the SA Museum next month.
Thin Ice is a collaboration between modern-day explorer and environmentalist Tim Jarvis, Adelaide animation and game design studio Monkeystack, and Torrens University film writer-director James Calvert. “Virtual reality is just an incredible medium to communicate with people because it’s the next best thing to actually being there and for many people, the Antarctic is just a bit too far away,” Jarvis said.
Participants in 3D goggles will undertake two journeys.
The first recreates pioneer Ernest Shackleton’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition of 1914-17. Then, a virtual version of Mr Jarvis will appear to take adventurers forward a century to the present day, and show the impact of climate change. “It’s a very powerful experience and it’s good fun – it’s adventure without the danger,” Jarvis said.
Thin Ice was meant to screen during July’s Illuminate festival but was postponed by a Covid-19 lockdown. It will now run at the SA Museum – which is home to 110,000 Australian polar collection items – from November 20 to February 6. Tickets go on sale for museum and Adelaide Film Festival members on Monday, and the general public on November 8, at thinicevr.com
