EDUCATION technology company Lumination set out in 2017 to transform the conventional classroom into an innovative lab.
In that time, it has grown from a garage in Semaphore to a multi-level building on the University of Adelaide’s Thebarton campus.
Catering for schools and industry, there are five virtual reality learning stations connected to high-powered computers and projectors to enable collaboration with fellow students or workers.
More than 2000 school students have visited the first learning lab in Kent Town since it was established in 2019, with 12 staff. The new lab is five times bigger.
Immersive and interactive experiences proved so popular with schools that the Education Department wanted its own learning labs, which are in nine schools so far. “Our foundations are in education but industry interest ramped up exponentially and started to become so loud it was hard to ignore,” Lumination’s chief commercial officer, Thomas Hastwell, said.
Between 2019 and 2021, Lumination experienced “exponential growth” and has begun working with defence contractor BAE Systems in the Tonsley Innovation District’s Factory of the Future and mining company OzMinerals.
A new office will open in Sydney next June, housing a further 90 to 100 workers, and there are plans for offices in the US at Dallas, New York and Los Angeles.
Founder and chief executive Edward Carlson set out, in 2017, to “disrupt” the conventional classroom, after returning home to Adelaide from working at Google in Sydney.
“We’re a proudly owned and operated Adelaide-based company that is supporting Adelaide and South Australia to be recognised on the world stage as a hub for innovation and collaboration, supporting local jobs and economic growth,” he said. Plympton Primary School student Kazys Stephens, 9, enjoyed his first taste of the learning lab this week and excitedly declared: “The space is amazing.”
