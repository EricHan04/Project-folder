“I’M no stranger to heartbreak.” It is a line uttered by Sandy in Grease, but it also echoes true for Sophie Monk.
The tumultuous love life of the 41-year-old singer, presenter and former star of The Bachelorette has been the subject of tabloid fodder and prime-time reality television since she became famous two decades ago.
But the twice-engaged Monk has finally gotten her happily-ever-after, thanks to a Christmas Day proposal from Joshua Gross, her partner since 2018.
To mark the occasion, Monk and Gross recreated iconic scenes from famous romantic films – including The Notebook, Pretty Woman and, yes, Grease – for Stellar magazine in tomorrow’s Sunday Mail.
Monk met Gross, a neurological robotics consultant, on a flight. “I got over people saying, ‘It will happen when you’re ready’,” Monk says. “I think you just have to be comfy in yourself and that’s when the right thing comes along.”
