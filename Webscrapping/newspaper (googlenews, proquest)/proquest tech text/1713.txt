A DIVERSE crowd of primary producers, agriculture technology startups and established agtech companies flocked to the inaugural AdvanceAg showcase, held at the Adelaide Showground late last month.
The showcase was presented by PIRSA and featured keynote speakers Astorre Modena from Israel's Terra Venture Partners and Thomas Foods International chief executive officer Darren Thomas.
After the keynote speakers, three streams of sessions were held, featuring themes of farm management, remote sensing and IoT devices.
This was followed by two panel sessions, discussing the barriers to adopting agtech and the potential role agtech could play in bushfire response and recovery.
