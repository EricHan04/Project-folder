RED Centre bottle shops could soon have restrictions in place that will force them to notify cops of suspicious purchases as well as when a person buys grog three or more times in a day.
The proposed Liquor Commission changes would require venues to upgrade CCTV cameras and send emails to police when a person buys in excess of either three cartons of full-strength beer, 12 x 750ml bottles of wine, four 750ml bottles of spirits or 48 cans or bottles of ready-to-drink mixes.
The variation states: “All affected licensees must install, maintain and operate a camera surveillance system in compliance with the requirements and guidelines prescribed by the Director of Liquor Licensing.” This includes “CCTV camera surveillance at the point of sale designed and operated so as to record information regarding the items purchased, the use of the BDR scanner, interactions between the purchaser and the salesperson, the appearance of the purchaser and the appearance of the salesperson.” It further states the “licensee must retain all data captured by the camera surveillance system for not less than 14 days”. The Big Brother-esque proposal is part of the Liquor Commission’s plight towards “minimising alcohol-related harm in the community”. The Kulgera Hotel and the Erldunda Desert Oaks Resort could also have to abide by strict new laws that will see them inform police if they sell booze to a person on more than three occasions.
Under the new changes, the two venues could be banned from selling booze to people who live in restricted and alcohol-protected areas as well as people residing in the Pitjantjatjara Lands in South Australia and the Ngaanyatjarra Lands in Western Australia.
A representative of the Gap View Hotel called for the commission to make it clear what would happen to personal information they were required to collect and pass on to police.“People need to know what the data is being used for and how it will be used,” she said.
