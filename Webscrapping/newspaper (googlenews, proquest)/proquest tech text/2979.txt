HAVE you heard the one about the caterpillar and the ant?
It is virtually a love story and it is one of more than 300 events rolling out around the state for this year’s Nature Festival.
Herding Caterpillars is an augmented reality and virtual reality experience that showcases Adelaide’s biodiversity through the life cycle of the chequered copper butterfly, its host plant and its symbiotic relationship with a local species of black ant.
It will offer smartphone triggers in locations across Adelaide, a series of interactive sculptures and 360-degree VR performances.
Essentially, you will have a chance to experience life as ant nest-dwelling caterpillar, and who has not wanted to give that a try?
Butterfly Conservation SA chairman and Herding Caterpillars science director Gerry Butler said the relationship between the butterfly – lucia limbaria – and the ant was ­remarkable.
“We rediscovered this butterfly, the chequered copper, in Victoria Park in 2011, and this butterfly has a mutual symbiosis ­between its obligate ant and one host plant – oxalis perennans,” Mr Butler said.
“The caterpillar lives in the ant nest, and is brought out to feed on the oxalis by the ants.” He said that, in return, the caterpillar produced honeydew for the ants to feed on.
“Then it metamorphoses in the ant nest and the butterfly emerges from the ant hole when it matures. It is an amazing thing,” he said. TO FIND OUT HOW TO TAKE PART IN THE HERDING CATERPILLARS EXPERIENCE, OR ANY OTHER NATURE FESTIVAL EVENT, VISIT NATUREFESTIVAL.ORG.AU
