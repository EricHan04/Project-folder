RESEARCH and new courses in electronic warfare, crucial for the frigates and submarines to be built in Adelaide, will be boosted by a $5 million joint investment from the Defence Department and Flinders University.
The uni will offer courses in electronic warfare from next year, in partnership with industry training group DEWC.
A new senior professorship in the field will also be established. The courses and research will run from the Tonsley campus, which already hosts Flinders’ cyber security, robotics and related work that is complementary to electronic warfare.
Flinders Vice-Chancellor Colin Stirling said it demonstrated a commitment “to building a skilled workforce to meet the current and emerging needs of the defence sector”.
Electronic warfare is a vital aspect of modern defence, both for preventing interference and attacks against communications, surveillance, detection and electronic controls, and for the military to impede an enemy’s capability.Defence’s chief scientist Tanya Monro said the five-year project, for which Defence Science and Technology Group was also a funding partner, “exemplifies Defence’s strategy of co-investing with universities and industries to grow research capacity and training pathways in identified areas of national priority”.
