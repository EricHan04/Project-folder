South Australia sourced an average of just over 100 per cent of the electricity it needed from renewable power for 6Â½ days leading up to December 29 last year - a record for the state and perhaps for comparable energy grids around the world.
The state's previous record was just over three days, says Geoff Eldridge, an energy analyst who runs the website NEMlog.com.au, which tracks the operations of the National Energy Market covering east-coast states and South Australia.
His analysis shows that for the six days identified, the state produced on average 101 per cent of the energy it needed from wind, rooftop solar and solar farms, with just a fraction of the energy used being drawn from gas, in order to keep the grid stable.
At times during the period, slightly less renewable energy was available and, at other times, renewable capacity was higher than needed, he says. Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said he believed that aside from some small island grids, such as those in Hawaii and Tasmania, it was likely that SA's six-day run on renewables was a record for a grid supporting an advanced economy.
During the unprecedented 156-hour renewable run, the share of wind in total energy supplied averaged 64.4 per cent, while rooftop solar averaged 29.5 per cent and utility-scale solar averaged 6.2 per cent, clean energy website RenewEconomy.com.au reported, using Mr Eldridge's data.
While Australia often receives poor international press regarding its climate policies, the nation's rapid uptake of renewables is also receiving international attention. A recent episode of the podcast The Energy Gang, produced in the US by global energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, focused on Australia's success in incorporating renewables into its grid to total 24 per cent, highlighting the uptake of batteries that both store renewable energy when it is not needed and help stabilise a system originally built to transmit power from huge providers such as coal power stations.
Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency show the cost of installing residential solar in Australia is similar to nations with far cheaper labour costs such as Thailand and Malaysia, and is much cheaper than in the US and Europe.
