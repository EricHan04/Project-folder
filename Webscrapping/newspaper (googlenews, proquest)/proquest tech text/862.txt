But 2000 was also an opportunity for savvy – and lucky – investors to make massive sharemarket profits.
An analysis by News Corp and investment management group Ausbil shows more than one-third of our biggest stocks have at least doubled investors’ money since the turn of the century — and at least 10 per cent of them have delivered returns above 1000 per cent.
It makes this month’s 12 per cent sharemarket rise just a small blip on the radar.
The top 20 shares of the past 20 years have some common traits, say investment specialists, but they warn trying to pick the big winners of the next 20 years is tough amid massive global transformation.
“Twelve months is a long time in this market,” said Ausbil Investment Management founder Paul Xiradis.
Ausbil examined ASX 300 companies for share price growth and dividends for the 20 years to November 2020, and found a clear standout: Fortescue Metals Group, which was started by Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest as a small mineral explorer and grew into a global iron ore giant.
It has delivered shareholders total returns of more than 330,000 per cent, which equates to 50 per cent a year.
“There was an incredible amount of hurdles it had to overcome to get there, but to the credit of Andrew Forrest he had the vision,” Mr Xiradis said
“Now it’s one of the highest-paying dividend stocks in the market.”
Number two, REA Group, has delivered total returns above 70,000 per cent by building online property giant realestate.com.au and expanding overseas.

Mr Xiradis said REA had “first mover advantage” in property and the relatively low cost of scaling up online platforms, making for great profit growth.
Number three stock, Data#3, had ridden the cloud technology wave, he said, while health care giant Ramsay Health Care was number four.
“They put health first and business second, and that’s been a very strong formula over the years,” Mr Xiradis said.
“They have managed to roll that out globally.”
Mr Xiradis said finding future winners started with spotting companies that were “clear leaders in their field” and had a long-term growth profile.
“Having a diversified portfolio is wise … some of the big brand names of 20 years ago haven’t performed.”
AMP and Telstra are among the weakest big names since 2000. AMP’s total return is negative 32 per cent.
Only 123 of the ASX 300 companies from 2000 remain there today. Many were merged, taken over, collapsed or replaced by newcomers such as Afterpay, ZipCo, JB Hi Fi and SEEK.
Afterpay launched on the ASX in 2017 and has enjoyed a 3000 per cent-plus share price rise. Tech stock Appen is up more than 5000 per cent since listing in 2015, while some resources companies have enjoyed huge gains.
However, they still lag 20-year veterans and sharemarket stayers such as Fortescue and REA Group.
Investment advice firm Baker Young’s managed portfolio analyst, Toby Grimm, said Fortescue was an example of taking big risks to get big rewards.
“Fortescue went from a minnow nipping at the heels of Rio and BHP to a bona fide giant in its own right,” he said.
Mr Grimm said rapid advances in technology meant “entire sectors could fall by the wayside” in the future.
“You can’t say that any company is going to be a winner in 20 years’ time,” he said.
Mr Grimm said successful investment most of the time “means doing nothing” and the best way to manage risk was to diversify across sectors and stocks.
“The tendency is to over-think and overtrade,” he said.
Mr Grimm said the Fortescues of the future would emerge from ideas and advances “that people haven’t yet thought about”.
“Technologies that will turn the operation of business upside down have yet to be invented, so how can we know who will invent them?”
Bell Direct market analyst Jessica Amir said investors should think about technology and consumer trends, and seek companies with strong management and momentum in profit growth.
“Are their earnings growing? What drives share price growth is earnings growth,” she said.
Ms Amir said commodity stocks such as mining companies should continue to do well as the world’s economy recovered from the COVID slump, and investors should consider “the clean and green economy”.
She said educating yourself was essential, with free help available online through online stockbrokers and other providers, or people could seek professional advice.
“We are seeing an emergence of cowboys saying ‘buy this stock, buy that stock’,” Mr Amir said.
SECTORS TO WATCH BEYOND 2020
• HEALTH CARE: The coronavirus has highlighted just how valuable good biotechnology companies and health services can be.
• TECHNOLOGY: It’s been the biggest growth area on the planet – Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft now dominate global financial markets, and new players will emerge.
• AGRICULTURE: The world needs to feed its growing population, so keep an eye on producers, fertilisers and other agribusinesses.
• MINING: Miners and other commodity stocks are expected to benefit as all nations demand natural resources to fuel post-COVID infrastructure booms.
• RENEWABLE ENERGY: The US – and the world – looks set to step up the fight against climate change and fossil fuels, and a new breed energy companies will play a key role.
• ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY: Businesses that improve energy use, wastewater treatment and soil are among those likely to do well.
• SPACE: Elon Musk’s private company SpaceX is now ferrying astronauts into orbit, but local space-based listings may emerge in areas such as satellites and communications.
HOW TO PICK LONG-TERM WINNERS
Investment specialists suggest focusing on companies that:
• Have a sustainable competitive advantage.
• Possess an enduring business model likely to benefit from long-term economic, social and technological trends.
• Have quality management with a proven track record.
• Are a clear leader in their field of expertise.
• Remain a single-purpose company rather try to expand into fresh areas where they lack experience.
