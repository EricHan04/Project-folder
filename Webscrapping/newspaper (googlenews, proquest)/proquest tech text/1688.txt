Applications seeking South Australian emerging female leaders passionate about facilitating change in rural and regional Australia for the 2022 AgriFutures Rural Women's Award are now open.
The Rural Women's Award is Australia's leading award in acknowledging and supporting the vital role women play in rural industries, businesses and communities.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham said following the cancellation of the 2021 program due to COVID-19 restrictions, it was pleasing to see nominations open.
"This award celebrates the important role women play in our regions and the development of female leaders now and into the future," he said.
"The South Australian winner will not only join an impressive alumni network, but through a $15,000 bursary will be able to bring to life a project or initiative that will be of benefit to our regions.
"Rural and regional South Australia is blessed with the many talented women who have made significant contributions to their communities and I am excited to see the next generation of leaders who are aspiring to make their own positive mark in their fields of endeavour."
Mr Basham encouraged any woman who is passionate about making rural industries and communities even greater to consider applying for the award.
"The Rural Women's Award is open to all women involved in rural and regional industries, businesses and communities," he said.
Past South Australian winners of the Rural Women's Award include 2015 National Rural Women's Award winner and 'Champions Academy' founder, Sarah Powell, 'George the Farmer' creator Simone Kain, south east livestock producer and AgTech advisory group member Penny Schulz, former Potatoes SA chief executive Robbie Davis, psychologist Stephanie Schmidt, and farm health and safety advocate Alex Thomas.
