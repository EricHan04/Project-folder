AFTER a 20-year absence, the memorable Timezone arcade is making a return. The game venue has been integrated into the revamped Zone Bowling Woodville and opened briefly earlier this month before the Covid-19 lockdown forced its temporary closure.
There are more than 80 arcade games, including new drawcards and old favourites such as the popular ride Virtual Reality Rabbids and Mario Kart.
Along with the arcade games are 24 bowling lanes, bumper cars and a laser tag arena.
Timezone Australia general manager Kane Fong said the development was exciting for everyone in Adelaide – young or old.
“The work at Zone Bowling Woodville is more than a renovation, it’s more of a re-creation of the family entertainment experience in Adelaide,” he said.
It follows a resurgence in old-school technology, most notably the record player.
As part of the development, the Woodville site will have two new function/party rooms for everything from children’s birthdays to team- building corporate events.
“Interstate, the Timezone and Zone Bowling venues have gained in popularity with a variety of audiences lately, so we’re keen to see Timezone become a family favourite again in South Australia,” Mr Fong said.
Timezone is scheduled to reopen on July 28 when Covid-19 restrictions are expected to be scaled back. Timezone celebrated 40 years of operation in 2018 having come a long way since the 1980s, when arcades were typically the hangouts of bored teenagers.
