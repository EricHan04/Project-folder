SPACECRAFT for Australia’s first mission to the moon, Lunar Ascent, will be built by an Australian aerospace outfit Space Machines Company, in what is being described as a giant leap for the local manufacturing industry.
Space Machines founder and chief executive Rajat Kulshretha saidmanufacturing for the spacecraft would take place in Mascot, close to Sydney airport, and the mission would be launched in 2021.
Mr Kulshretha said his company would offer “ride-sharing” organisations seeking to place payloads, like satellites, in lunar orbit.
Interested parties can book cargo starting from about $US200,000 ($260,000) a kilogram, which the executive said was a third less expensive than US-based competition. Sydney based Spiral Blue and HEO Robotics have signed a letter of intent to be the first customers sending a payload to the moon on the Lunar Ascent mission, and Deloitte is an early backer.
