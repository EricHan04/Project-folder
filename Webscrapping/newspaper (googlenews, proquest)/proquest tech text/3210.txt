Creating projects will take on an exciting new twist for students of Lincoln Gardens Primary School, after winning a 3D printer as a competition prize.
Initially the school won a $5000 grant from the company Makers Empire to take part in a series of training programs to educate teachers on how to use design and a printing program to solve problems.
Lincoln Gardens Primary School have won a state wide 3D printing competition run by Makers Empire which has earned them a new 3D printer.
After the training the participating schools had to submit a presentation showing how teachers and students used the program find answers to a problem.
The Lincoln Gardens team of Hamish Rowsell and Neil Seaman used the year 3/4 class to trial the program to solve the imaginary problem of people using counterfeit paper tickets to purchase a meal in the library's cafe.
In order to solve the dilemma students investigated counterfeiting and existing coin designs to come up with a token that could be 3D printed and not replicated by any student.
At the conclusion of the design process the staff voted on the best design to be printed for use at this year's Library Caf√©. During the process footage was taken and made into a three minute movie showing the progress of the designs made by the students.
The school was voted best in South Australia for the competition and was given a new 3D printer, filament for the printer and a year's subscription to the Makers Empire program, which totals $4000.
