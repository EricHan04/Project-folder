OPPOSITION Leader Anthony Albanese slammed the Morrison government as ­climate change “numpties” and promised a green jobs revolution, a fortnight out from election day.
The re-energised Labor leader attended a campaign rally at Launceston in the marginal seat of Bass, where he promised a $20m green energy package.
This included $5m for the George Town hydrogen project, which would power the state’s trucks and buses, which currently run on diesel, with green energy.
He also announced an $11m partnership with poultry giant Ingham’s to introduce a carbon zero-certified business model that will protect more than 120 local jobs.
“We can be a renewable ­energy superpower if we take up the opportunity which is there,” Mr Albanese said.
“This government had 22 energy policies and haven’t landed one of them. Scott Morrison came to Glasgow and gave an empty speech to an empty room,” he said.
“What does it take to give some of these numpties a wake-up call to tell them climate change is right here, right now.” Mr Albanese also declared Australia needed to be “more self-reliant” through investment manufacturing.
Labor is trying to unseat Liberal MP for Bass Bridget Archer, who holds the seat by just 0.5 per cent.
Mr Albanese spruiked Labor’s plan to strengthen Medicare and implement an anti-corruption watchdog.
In some lighter moments, an energised Mr Albanese declared Mr Morrison was no Mick Jagger, which had the party faithful roaring with laughter.
“Scott Morrison says that it’s better the devil you know … But the truth is that only the Rolling Stones ever got away with asking us to have sympathy for the devil,” he said. “And he’s certainly not Jagger or Richards.”
