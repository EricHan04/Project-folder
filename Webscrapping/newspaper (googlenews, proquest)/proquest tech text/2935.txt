ADELAIDE-based aerial mapping company Aerometrex has reported a small loss in its first year as a listed company.
Revenue was up 24.7 per cent to $20.1m in the 12 months to June, bolstered by growth in the company’s LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) division, 3D digital models business and MetroMap subscriptions. However, one-off costs associated with public listing, and other expenditure increases, resulted in a $266,000 loss, down from a $2.6m profit the previous year.
Aerometrex managing director Mark Deuter (pictured) said he was pleased with the performance in light of the “disruption caused to the world economy”.
Aerometrex said the continued growth of the MetroMap aerial imagery data service was a priority in the current financial year, as was the development of overseas revenue streams. “Additionally, Aerometrex is assessing potential merger and acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis that would align with the company’s product offering,” Mr Deuter said.
