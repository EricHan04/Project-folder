Virtual reality opens up an underwater wonderland
“THERE’S a scuba diver behind me and I can see jellyfish!” 13-year-old Oscar Bohmer says, pointing to his right.
The teenager from Bedford Park, who lives with autism, is describing the underwater flash of several squid-like cuttlefish just centimetres from his grasp.
It’s the first time he’s seen one – but he’s not got a drop of water on him. And he’s at least 390km south of the Upper Spencer Gulf waters, where up to 175,000 giant cuttlefish are now amassing to keep the species alive.
Oscar is, instead, in Adelaide, trialling a virtual-reality experience of the unique annual migration of cuttlefish to waters off Whyalla from June to August.
For many children like Oscar living with autism, the experience of pulling on a wetsuit and being immersed in cold, salty water from head to toe would cause significant anxiety and sensory overload.
It’s part of the reason why Adelaide ocean photographer Carl Charter has developed a first-of-a-kind virtual-reality experience of the cuttlefish breeding migration that occurs between Fitzgerald Bay and False Bay.
“I came up with the concept because so many people have told me they want to experience the cuttlefish migration but can’t because of disability, age or distance,” says Mr Charter, whose son and nephew live with autism.
He operates Experiencing Marine Sanctuaries, which runs cuttlefish snorkelling tours for hundreds of schoolchildren and adults every year, and in April organised the first South Australian wheelchair snorkel trial at West Lakes.
He will visit Oscar’s schoolmates at Suneden Specialist School, in Mitchell Park, in coming months to share the VR cuttlefish experience.
“I think it’s amazing,” says Suneden’s co-principal, Helen Motta.“It could lead our students to try something like this in the real world because it may help break down sensory fears and anxieties by immersing them in what it could really be like.”
