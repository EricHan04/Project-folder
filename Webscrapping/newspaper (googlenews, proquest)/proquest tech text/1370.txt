LILY AND STEVE RICHARDS, INGLE FARM Our recent trip included a few locations that many travellers would also have on the well-known “bucket list”. In Orlando we visited Universal Studios, above, Kennedy Space Centre (SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy blasted off less than a week after we viewed it), top, the 1565 town of St Augustine and I Drive (International Drive). From Ft Lauderdale we began a three-week Panama Canal cruise and that one day transit experience alone justifies the accolades and the hundreds of millions of dollars it cost to construct. The Miraflores Lock area, below, varies the water level by about 56’ (17m) in two stages. Diverse stops en route to Vancouver were Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Mexico, as well as LA, Santa Barbara, San Francisco and Astoria.
