MORE than 1000 Australian and international delegates are expected to attend the Australian Wine Industry Technical Conference in Adelaide this week.
McLaren Vale-based Oliver’s Taranga winemaker and director Corrina Wright, who will be opening the conference, said she was looking forward to key updates during the industry-wide event.
“I am really interested in Wine Australia’s updates on its significant three-year package of $50 million to support exports,” she said.
“It’s going to help local wine producers, especially during Aussie Wine Month to be held in September in the US, which we are attending.” Ms Wright was also keen to hear about wine tourism updates and gauge industry reactions to the a recent report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which found harmful market practices are restricting competition in some Australian wine grape-growing regions and limiting the potential for growth of Australia’s wine industry.
“But the session I am most excited about it is the discussion around diversity in the sector,” she said.
“There are less than 10 per cent of us in wine production, so it’s good to be discussing the issue of diversity and equality in this space.” The Australian Wine Industry Technical Conference is being held at the Adelaide Convention Centre until July 24.
It also incorporates the Australian Grape & Wine Outlook business and marketing sessions and has a trade exhibition featuring the latest technologies and services.
The event features a stellar line-up of speakers today, including Alibaba Group’s Maggie Zhou speaking about on China, Wine Australia’s Andreas Clark on the wine industry outlook, and a “coalface” talk by Seppeltsfield managing director Warren Randall.The Tuesday and Wednesday sessions will focus on the science behind grapes, and vineyards and agtech.
