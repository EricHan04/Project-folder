MAKE Chris Bowen sit the IKEA test before he does one more thing to change how we power Australia.
The IKEA test is one millions of us have failed, learning the humbling lesson that plans rarely work out perfectly the first time.
There we are, just trying to assemble, say, an IKEA Kleppstad wardrobe and … damnit! We’ve put a panel on backwards. Re-do.
But Bowen, our fervent Energy and Climate Change Minister, talks like he’s never wrestled with IKEA. And it’s this “it’ll-be-perfect” zealotry that makes warmists so dangerous.
Bowen babbles about his plan to change how we fuel our cars, power our homes and electrify our industries.
“We have a world-class Integrated System Plan for the transformation of the electricity grid,” he declares.
End coal-fired power! Get 82 per cent renewable energy in just eight years! Plus electric cars – 50 per cent of new car sales by 2030! And it will work!
Really? In the Good Weekend magazine motoring writer Tony Davis actually checked Bowen’s dream.
Davis is no warming sceptic and likes the electric cars he’s given to test. But it’s hard to ignore the problems with them when he’s standing at a charging station on his way to Canberra and finding that charging his car to just 80 per cent will take 100 minutes.
Then, finally in Canberra, finding another charger was “a lot harder than it should’ve been”, and “I sat in the car and worked while it slowly powered the car up”.
How often does reality laugh like this at green dreams? In 2007, former Climate Change Commissioner Tim Flannery insisted there was so much energy in hot rocks deep underground in South Australia that we could “run the Australian economy for the best part of a century”. Oops. The wells blocked. Total flop. Despite this history, the Albanese government talks as if none of its ministers ever had a plan that didn’t work out perfectly. So make Bowen at least sit an IKEA test. Can he even assemble a desk?
