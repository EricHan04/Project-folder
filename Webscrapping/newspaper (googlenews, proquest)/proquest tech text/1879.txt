INCREASED solar power and improved energy efficiency are benefiting some SA households but is forcing up average electricity prices.
The Australian Energy Regulator yesterday approved a price increase averaging $59 a year on residential bills proposed by distributor SA Power Networks for next financial year.
The regulator accepted that as well as inflation it should account for SA Power Networks making less revenue than earlier expected because of declining demand.
Nearly a third of SA’s 780,000 residential customers and 10 per cent of the 98,000 business customers now have solar photovoltaic panels.
This investment plus more energy-efficient appliances and customers cutting energy use in response to high retail prices meant less electricity was being sold.
SAPN is being allowed to “top up” its tariffs because pricing frameworks are set over five-year periods, with 2019-20 being the last of a period that began on July 1, 2014.
Back then, the regulator determined SAPN could recover $3.8 billion over the five financial years and this allows it to catch up with that target even though sales fell short of expectations.
SAPN had asked for a $46 increase for its distribution and metering services plus a $6 increase for transmission charges from ElectraNet and Murraylink and $7 for the State Government’s solar feed-in tariff scheme. SAPN collects the latter charges from retailers and passes them through.
The household bill is made up of these costs plus wholesale costs of generating energy, the retailer’s costs, federal environmental costs and GST.
Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan, pictured, said the final increase would not be as high as $59 because “fortunately for consumers, the AER has confirmed that wholesale prices have reduced”.The final, net effect, on bills is expected to be about 0.5 per cent or $11 a year on an average residential account.
