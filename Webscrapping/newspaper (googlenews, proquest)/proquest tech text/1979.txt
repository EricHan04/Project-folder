JAPANESE manufacturing giant Kawasaki Heavy Industries and gas producer Santos have agreed to work with the South Australian government to accelerate the development of the hydrogen industry.
On the second day of a trip to Japan and Korea, Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was “outstanding” that two of the biggest companies in the Australian and Japanese markets had signed a statement of co-operation.
“I hope throughout this trip I will be able to secure additional signatures as we build a groundswell of momentum behind South Australia’s hydrogen agenda,” he said.
“This statement of co-operation is a commitment from the state government and industry partners to work together to accelerate the development of South Australia’s hydrogen economy.” Santos president of midstream and clean fuels Brett Woods said “Santos and South Australia have the potential to become leaders in decarbonisation”.
“We are pleased to support the South Australian government’s Statement of Cooperation as it aligns with our plans to develop decarbonisation technologies and clean fuels solutions, including carbon capture and storage and a range of hydrogen-based fuel solutions, as customer demand increases,” he said.
In a speech to the Australia Japan Business Conference run by the Japan Australia Business Cooperation Committee, Mr Malinauskas spoke on Monday of the economic potential of renewable energy.
“What we seek, and what we aspire for, is a collaborative relationship between our government to develop that resource in conjunction with Japanese industry, know-how and power to be able to realise that potential. “In order for both Japan and Australia to realise its ambition to be global leaders in decarbonisation, hydrogen will be central to this pursuit,” said Mr Malinauskas.
