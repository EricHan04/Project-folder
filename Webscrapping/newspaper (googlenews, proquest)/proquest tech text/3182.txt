A VIRTUAL submarine engine room has been developed to train South Australia’s future ship building workforce.
The technology will be used in TAFE SA’s Diploma of Engineering Technical course.
The program, developed by TAFE SA and Odyssee Aus, allows students to explore a submarine engine room and immerse themselves in real-world shipbuilding scenarios.
Premier Steven Marshall said thousands of SA workers would be required to meet the needs of defence work in the coming years and this program would equip people with the requisite skills.
TAFE SA chief executive David Coltman, pictured, said: “The convenience of being able to have access and explore a 3D virtual environment of a ship’s engine room will provide invaluable context and build student understanding of the complex systems and constraints (of ship design).” Odyssee Aus director Eric Fusil said the program would deliver “the right skills for the detailed design work … required for the Hunter Class Frigate and Attack Class submarines”.
