Question of the week
This week's question Do you believe the federal government's incoming Ag Visa will address the skills shortage in all agricultural industries?
Yes No Last week's results Have you introduced agtech into your operation in recent years?
Yes.........................................................100pc No............................................................0pc EDITORIAL It's a bit of a strange situation that what starts out as people wanting to put their hand up to help develop and guide their industry can often turn into a somewhat contentious time.
But it seems elections for industry bodies, such as the upcoming one linked for three new board members on Australian Wool Innovation, does stir up some feelings.
Everyone has their thoughts on what the industry needs and who is best-placed to get it there - like all politics really.
The debates at the moment revolve about whether it is processors, growers, marketers that provide the skills most needed to drive forward a sector that remains an important part of Australia's agricultural industry and economy in general.
I think the central concept we should all remember is that with these bodies, it is grower money that goes into them.
That means the growers have a vested interest in making sure they feel represented and that their funds are being put to the best use.
And like with every election, if you haven't cast your vote, it is a little bit trickier to then complain about the outcomes.
So whether it's the upcoming AWI election, or WoolPoll, or the Dairy Poll next year, the central message is that if you're eligible to vote, take the time to look at the options and have your say.
