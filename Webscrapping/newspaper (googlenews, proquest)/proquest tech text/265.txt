RENEWABLE energy represented nearly 70 per cent of the power used in South Australia over the past financial year, a new report reveals.
Data in the Open National Energy Market report showed the portion of electricity supplied by wind and solar had risen to 68.3 per cent – up seven per cent since the previous financial year.
Deputy Premier Susan Close, who is also Climate, Environment and Water Minister, said “South Australia’s aspirational goal towards carbon neutrality is now within reach”.
“These results show that there is no doubt that South Australia continues its leadership in renewable energy,” Dr Close said. On Easter Sunday this year, wind-generated power alone supplied 136.6 per cent of electricity demand.
