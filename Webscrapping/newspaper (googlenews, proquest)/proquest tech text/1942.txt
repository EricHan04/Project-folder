Atmos’s owner, global investment manager Igneo Infrastructure Partners (Igneo) has struck a deal to buy Elliott, which owns the Childers, Susan River and Nevertire solar farms, with a combined capacity of 302MW.
Each solar farm also includes a “well-advanced”, co-located battery development, with construction expected to start on each of these during this calendar year.
Atmos already has significant capacity in Australia including the Hornsdale 1, 2 and 3 wind farms in South Australia as well as two solar farms in Queensland, two wind farms in Victoria and the Granville Harbour wind farm in Tasmania.
The newly-acquired assets each have long term offtake agreements, Igneo said.
“Upon transaction completion Atmos Renewables will be the fourth largest owner of operating renewable energy assets in Australia with a diverse portfolio of wind and solar farms across each state of the National Electricity Market,’’ the company said in a statement.
“The portfolio will consist of interests in seven operating wind farms and five operating solar farms with a total economic capacity of 865MW.
“This marks the fourth successful acquisition by Igneo since Atmos Renewables was established in 2020.
“The transaction delivers on our objective to create a market leading Australian renewables business with internal management capability to deliver sustained growth and value for our investors.’’
The transaction is expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year.
