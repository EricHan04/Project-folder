PREPARING the sheep industry for the future was front and centre at a Sheep Focus workshop held at Snowtown on Friday.
The brainchild of sheep seed stock producer and Meat & Livestock Australia director Andrew Michael, Snowtown, alongside Livestock SA, the event included several speakers looking at ways to improve the future flock in SA.
Speakers included consultant Jason Trompf, speaking about breeding the ewe of the future, a look at market potential from Mecardo managing director Robert Hermann, insight into selling options, genomics, a look at the newly-relaunched SA Sheep Industry Blueprint and methods for improving the uptake of AgTech in livestock production systems.
There was also some insight into new research into pain management in humans and how it could transfer across to livestock and improve both welfare outcomes and production.
Mr Michael said the goal of the day was to look at potential areas of improvement and growth for the sector.
"Speakers will push the boundary and tell it as it is for where the industry has to go," he said.
"Adoption is one thing we need to take away from the day."

Mr Hermann said it was important for sheep producers to be proactive rather than passive about where they wanted to see the industry.
"Individuals have all got a role to play to see the industry thrive," he said.
"If one person is doing it, they get a little bit done, but if we all get involved, we can kick it down the street."
