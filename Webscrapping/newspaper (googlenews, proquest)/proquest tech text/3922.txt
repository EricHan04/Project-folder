STUDENTS at Mark Oliphant College will step into the modern world of manufacturing through a $2.6m upgrade of the northern suburbs school.
Designs have been finalised for a new innovation laboratory that will feature robotics and 3D printing.
The upgrade to the Munno Para campus will also create new flexible spaces for food technology, art and other lessons.
“We’re moving from the traditional skills like woodworking lathes to more modern approaches,” principal Kym Grant said yesterday.
“There is genuine need in the school for that sort of technology. “We’ll still have the basic woodworking equipment but that’ll mostly be for students in junior years.” Mr Grant said food technology also was in high demand.
“We already have a commercial kitchen on site but it’ll be under pressure for practical space because of the Year 7s coming into high school from 2022. So we’ve gone for a home economics space with stoves and so on.” Designs by architectural firm Grieve Gillett Andersen have been published by the Education Department.
The upgrade will create spaces for teaching a variety of courses, including child studies.
“We’re really looking forward to it,” Mr Grant said.
“There’s been a lot of consultation with teachers and the community.” Acting Education Minister Michelle Lensink was pleased construction would start soon.
“Local families will undoubtedly be looking forward to construction beginning on these expansions and seeing these concept plans being brought to life in the coming months,” she said.
“Along with the rest of our record $1.3bn education build, this is a significant investment in the future of our children that will boost the state’s economy and drive thousands of jobs statewide.” This year marks the 10th anniversary of Mark Oliphant College operating from its Douglas Drive campus. It was formed in 2010 by combining the Smithfield Plains kindergarten, junior primary, primary and high schools.
