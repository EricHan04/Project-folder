Under a world-first scheme, 20 Housing SA properties will have a battery installed to enable them to join the state’s Virtual Power Plant.
Tenants in the trial will benefit from reduced electricity rates when they are connected to the network, which is controlled by Tesla.
Energy and Mining Minister Dan Van Holst Pellekaan said if successful, the program could be rolled out to other homes unable to host solar systems.
“This … could be a game-changer for thousands of South Australians who can’t benefit from solar power, and the latest example of SA’s international leadership on home batteries,” he said.
“Tesla will use the plentiful supply of renewable electricity generated by … rooftop solar to charge the batteries for the evening peak.”
At the moment, all other homes connected to the network have their own rooftop solar systems and store energy in their battery or release it back into the grid.
“What we’re moving into today, that’s so exciting, is being able to do exactly that without the solar,” Mr van Holst Pellekaan said.
“So what that would mean is, for homes that might not be quite right for solar … the battery alone can still deliver the 29 per cent savings on electricity prices that other housing trust and public housing homes are receiving.”
The project is part of phase three of the VPP rollout. This stage will also include solar system and battery installation in another 3000 Housing SA properties, taking the total number of homes involved to 4100.
Munno Para resident Wendy Brown, who has already had a battery and solar system installed, said her electricity bills have been halved.
“I’m very relieved,” she said.
“It’s changed my life a lot. I’ve always got money now - I’m not broke.”
The state government is contributing $10 million to stage three, while the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is contributing $8 million, Tesla $18 million and the Clear Energy Finance Corporation is loaning $30 million.
