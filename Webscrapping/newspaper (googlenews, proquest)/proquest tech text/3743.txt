THE marketing committee of the RA&HS of SA were on the money when they set the tagline for the Royal Adelaide Show as the 'Big Reunion'.
It was great to get out and see people that we hadn't seen for three years, and catch up on their stories and news. Some of the best moments are the conversations between sashings.
While there are those that say the show has lost its country roots, they are obviously standing in the wrong part of the showground, because I came away even more excited about the industry's prospects while at the state's biggest showcase of ag.
It was the conversation at lunch with someone who mentioned their city-born nephew wanted to work with robotics in ag, because that was where the exciting innovations were happening.
It was the conversation with a student, who had no real ag background, but said once he showed an interest, everyone in the industry had been "so nice" about supporting him.
It was watching a fashion parade of woollen garments in the sheep shed and remembering that the wool produced by those rams was creating some truly stunning garments.
I definitely need time to rest and recover, but I'm looking forward to September 2023.
