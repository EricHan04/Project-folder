OUR face can unlock a smartphone, provide access to a ­secure building and speed up passport control at airports, verifying our identity for numerous purposes.
An international team of ­researchers from Australia, New Zealand and India has taken facial recognition technology to the next level, using a person’s expression to ­manipulate objects in a virtual reality setting without the use of a handheld controller or touchpad.
In a world-first study led by the University of Queensland, human-computer interaction experts used neural processing techniques to capture a person’s smile, frown and clenched jaw and used each expression to trigger specific actions in virtual reality environments.
One of the researchers, University of South Australia’s Professor Mark Billinghurst, says the system has been designed to recognise different facial expressions via an EEG headset. “A smile was used to trigger the ‘move’ command, a frown for the ‘stop’ command and a clench for the ‘action’ command in place of a handheld controller performing these actions,” Professor Billinghurst said. “We are capturing common facial expressions … and implementing them in a virtual reality environment.”
