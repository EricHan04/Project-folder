DRAKES Supermarkets opened its $125 million distribution centre in Edinburgh North yesterday, with the new state of the art facility to employ 140 full-time staff.
The centre, which was fully funded by the family-owned company, is equivalent in size to 40 Olympic sized swimming pools, incorporates $15 million worth of robotics and houses 23,000 separate lines of products, making it the most advanced independent distribution and logistics centre of its kind, managing director Roger Drake said.
“Our aim is to save the average South Australian family around $20 per week at the check-out which equates to over $1000 per year, by just having direct relationships with our suppliers and cutting out the middleman,’’ he said.
“We are a South Australian, family owned and operated business who has taken the leap to go out on our own, take on the big corporations and provide our customers the biggest range of products for the best possible prices.” The robotic system used in the distribution centre is the first of its type in production and will be used to individually pick inventory items for store replenishment using a “goods-to-person” configuration, ensuring accuracy of store orders and leading to superior deliveries and lower cost, the company said.The Drakes management team travelled around Europe, visiting five different countries to obtain greater insight into the advanced robotics, distribution and logistics systems within the industry.
