SHARES in aerial-mapping provider Nearmap soared on Monday after the company revealed it is mulling a $1.06bn takeover bid from US private equity giant Thoma Bravo, with the companies in advanced due diligence.
Executives at Nearmap, which is set to release its annual results on Wednesday, declined to comment but the company said in a statement to investors that it had received interest from other US-based potential suitors, though none have come close to Thoma Bravo’s $2.10 per share offer, which places a 39 per cent premium on Nearmap’s closing share price last Friday. Its shares rose by 24.8 per cent on Monday to $1.885.
