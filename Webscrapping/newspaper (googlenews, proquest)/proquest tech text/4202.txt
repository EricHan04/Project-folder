Naracoorte High School has transformed its former music and drama space into a $2.5m STEM Building, with state-of-the-art technology, including robotics and virtual reality.
Emceeing the event were school captains Tayla Standley and Oscar Peltz, and Principal John Harris credited the previous principal, Kim Grant, for also helping to see the project to completion.
The new STEM Building is highly visible and accessible, with both indoor and outdoor working spaces for students's studies.
Member for MacKillop Nick McBride officially opened the STEM Centre with Mr Harris.
Mr McBride stated that with the multitude of defence jobs lined up for Port Adelaide in the future, then more students graduating as engineers, designers, etc., the better for the state's economy.
The Building Better Regions Fund (BBRF) is an initiative by the Federal Government to create jobs, drive economic growth and build stronger regional communities into the future.
Labor MLC Clare Scriven was also in attendance, with Labor candidate for Barker Mat O'Brien.
Mr O'Brien stated that with the Australian job market rapidly changing, students gaining STEM skills was vital, and that the state should take pride in facilities such as the Naracoorte High Stem Centre.
Ms Scriven was pleased to attend the opening, and was impressed by the innovative technology that students would have access to.
Like Mr O'Brien, Ms Scriven was pleased to see that students were gaining skills that would prepare them for a modern job market focused on digital technology and design.
