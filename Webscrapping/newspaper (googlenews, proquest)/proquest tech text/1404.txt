It’s a case of six degrees of celebration for Commercial SA, writes tom bowden
It’s been a challenging year for Adelaide’s commercial property agents, Commercial SA director Evan Florinis says, but the good news for sellers is there’s still strong demand for quality property.
The agency was last week awarded commercial and industrial agency of the year – a prize it has won five times – and Mr Florinis says the company will continue to strive to perform at the best of its ability.
“We’ve added the words ‘finding better’ to our logo because it’s a culture we’ve always had here in our business,” he says. “As a business, we’re always endeavouring to do better in everything we do. We’ve had a good year in which we’ve kicked some goals and we’re navigating our way through the land tax issue. We’ve had good sales and we’re still finding there’s good buying interest on most sides of the commercial property market. For good properties there’s still really strong demand.” Mr Florinis says growth in sectors such as film, space exploration, manufacturing and mining have provided momentum during a challenging period.
“There are always the support businesses that need to be located, or need to grow to be able to deal with that extra work that’s coming in … so we are seeing some space being filled because of those industries growing,” he says.“Good-quality property across the board generally gets good demand and becomes a saleable asset. Everything is price-driven and everything is price-sensitive. We’re seeing some properties go well over and above expectations.”
