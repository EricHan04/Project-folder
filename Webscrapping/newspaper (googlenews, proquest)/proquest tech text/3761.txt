‘Always thought we’d elope’
SOPHIE Monk is officially no longer a Bachelorette after marrying her boyfriend Joshua Gross in a secret elopement at their home.
Monk and her neurosurgical robotics consultant partner – who she met on a long-haul flight from San Francisco to Sydney in 2018 following her reality TV stint on Network Ten’s The Bachelorette – married in a private ceremony for two, just three weeks ago.
In an exclusive interview with Stellar, which was invited along to capture the day, Monk reveals how she pulled the wedding together in less than three weeks and why the pair always planned to get married this way.
“We always thought we’d elope,” she told Stellar in their first interview as a married couple. “So many people said to me, ‘I didn’t even see my husband on the night; if I had my wedding over, we’d just elope’. So we thought, well, why don’t we just get married at home? “I’ve seen people get really stressed about their wedding and ours has been so stress-free.” The wedding took place without family and friends present, the couple sharing a romantic dinner after the ceremony.
“I’m 42, so I feel like (our loved ones) are like, OK, do it your way. We figured if we don’t invite one person then no one could get upset.” Monk wore two dresses by Melbourne designer J’Aton couture, the reality TV host trying both dresses on for the first time on the day.
“It fit like a glove, it was perfect – it was just how I’d imagined it,” she said.
“We didn’t give them long (to design it), but they’re pros. I sketched it out a couple of weeks ago with my stylist.
“I wanted to just keep it simple, beautiful and timeless, but still ‘bride’. I wanted two dresses, for two different looks.
“I wanted to keep it not too modern or in too many trends where you look back and the style has dated.
“Honestly, I wear ­uggies and trackpants every day; that’s my style.” STELLAR EXCLUSIVE: FULL STORY, MORE PICTURES INSIDE
