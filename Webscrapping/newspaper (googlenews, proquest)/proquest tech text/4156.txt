TUTORING
CLOSE to a quarter of respondents who have school-aged children said they were paying for their kids to get additional tutoring or coaching.
While specific details of the type of extra support wasn’t provided, almost double the number of metropolitan parents were paying for tutoring and coaching services than country mums and dads, with the highest percentage in the eastern suburbs.
As previously reported in the Sunday Mail, data from national school fees lender Edstart showed families were forking out, on average, $2276 per child each year on tutoring.Managing director of Hectorville-based Tutors SA Don Wenura Dissanayake said beyond core subjects in primary and secondary school there was growing interest in STEM-related courses and workshops. “(Students are enrolling in) robotics and coding, programming and other STEM-related courses to boost their interest and knowledge,” he said.
