SOUTH Australian astronaut Andy Thomas’s wife Shannon Walker has been selected to be aboard the first operational crewed flight of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft when it takes off for the International Space Station later this year.
US-born Dr Walker will join NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins and Victor Glover Jr, as well as Soichi Noguchi, from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on the six-month expedition.
The mission will be the first of a series of regular, rotational flights to the station.
It will form part of NASA’s commercial crew program.
Commercial transport to and from the station aims to provide more research time and opportunities for discovery on the orbital outpost.
Depending on a successful test flight in May, Dr Walker, Glover, Hopkins and Noguchi will launch aboard Crew Dragon on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. This is expected to occur later this year.As an astronaut, Dr Walker has spent 163 days as a flight engineer aboard the space station for Expeditions 24 and 25 in 2010. She has a bachelor’s degree in physics and a master’s and doctorate in space physics, all from Rice University in Houston.
