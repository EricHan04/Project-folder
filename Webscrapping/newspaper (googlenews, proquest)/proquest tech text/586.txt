Transport emissions rose more than 12 per cent in the last three months of 2021 as lockdown restrictions eased across the country, while Australia's greenhouse gas emissions decreased as renewable electricity generation continued to grow.
But experts warn that without serious climate policy Australia will struggle to hit its target of net-zero by 2050.
Analysis by environmental consultants Ndevr, using published and projected data, show the country's emissions in 2021 were 498.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent lower, or 1.1 per cent, than the previous year. The research attributed this to an increase in renewable electricity generation in the electricity sector.
While Tasmania was the first state to generate 100 per cent of its electricity from renewables in 2020, the Ndevr update found South Australia passed the 77 per cent mark last quarter. NSW and Victoria passed the 30 per cent mark of renewable energy electricity generation in the final three months of last year.
Matt Drum, Ndevr's managing director, warns these emissions figures will like increase in the coming months driven by a lack of climate policy, the war in Ukraine pushing world leaders to abandon Russia's energy market, increasing coal prices and people adjust to life post-pandemic.
"We have made a commitment of net-zero by 2050, but we need mechanisms in place and a plan in place to demonstrate some will and some action to hit those interim targets," he said.
"We don't want to get to December 30, 2049 and then start to try to reduce emissions.
"It's a work in progress and we need some action and some intervention."
"Under policy setting, there is little evidence to suggest we can [meet the net-zero by 2050 targets]. But I am hopeful."
