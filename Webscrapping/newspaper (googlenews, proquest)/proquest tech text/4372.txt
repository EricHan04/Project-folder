A coalition of 13 Aboriginal organisations want urgent action to ensure remote indigenous communities get basic groceries amid COVID-19 panic-buying.
Aboriginal leaders are calling for immediate federal government action to guarantee affordable groceries in remote communities, which are struggling to secure basic supplies due to coronavirus-driven panic-buying.
A coalition of 13 Aboriginal organisations including the Central Land Council will meet in Alice Springs on Monday to call for a point-of-sale subsidy for essential food, cleaning and personal hygiene products, winter bedding and clothes.
They also want the Commonwealth to compel producers to set aside goods for remote community stores.
Mai Wiru, a not-for-profit organisation that runs shops in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia's far northwest, recently said community stores were receiving as little as 40 per cent of their orders as suppliers met increased demand from big supermarkets.
Toilet paper and baby formula are among products in short supply.
Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt wrote to food suppliers earlier this month asking for their support, saying consumers in remote areas were also buying more than usual, depleting community stores as they were not able to travel to regional hubs for supplies.
