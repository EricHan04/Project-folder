The 2022 GrowingSA conference - the first in three years- was a sell out with more than 220 producers, industry and government representatives and others from across the supply chain coming together at Hahndorf to discuss the future of SA agriculture.
The recurring themes across the event hosted by Livestock SA and Grain Producers SA were the need for sustainability and emerging technology could assist with this, ensuring ag had strong advocacy groups and how best to overcome labour shortages in ag.
A new app was launched at the event by Primary Industries Minister Clare Scriven which helps producers recognise emergency animal diseases such as Foot & Mouth Disease through the use of world-leading augmented reality technology.
