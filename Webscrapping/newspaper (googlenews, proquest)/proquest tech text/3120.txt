SILICON Valley is in lockdown right now, but young Aussie inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs are making their mark on the technology world from Down Under.
From creating therapeutic robots and revolutionising clinical trials, to devising better coding kits, cryptocurrency platforms, virtual reality experiences, and kangaroo meat produced in a lab, young Aussie techies — including a swath of brilliant young Victorians — are smashing it.
We have identified 30 of the country’s brightest minds under 30 years who are thinking big, winning investments, and changing lives.
JAMES DALE 20, Melbourne CleanSky creator He might be a university student, but James Dale’s side-hustles attract a lot of attention and investments.
The 20-year-old’s recent project — a virtual yearbook for US students called HAGS (have a great summer) — has attracted $US1m ($1.3m) in investment, including money from Google’s venture capital arm.
He also led the Apple development side of Stanford University’s Pneumask Project to turn snorkel masks into medical equipment last year, and is probably best known for creating the app CleanSky that visually plots pollution levels and air quality on a map — an app he launched after the 2019 bushfires.
Mr Dale said finishing his university degree was also a priority so he could return to Apple in the US where he completed an internship. “I really want to keep that door open to go back to Apple,” he said.
ALEX & CHRIS NAOUMIDIS 25 and 23, Melbourne Mindset Health founders They call them “digital therapeutics,” and the apps produced by Alex and Chris Naoumidis are designed to make a medical difference to users.
Their first app, Nerva, saw them partner with Simone Peters of Monash University to deliver a six-week hypnotherapy course inside an app to provide relief from irritable bowel syndrome.
“There’s no strong treatments for IBS,” Alex said. “There’s a low FODMAP diet, but it doesn’t work for everyone.” The pair’s vision for hypnotherapy apps focused on treating single conditions won them a place in the esteemed Y Combinator accelerator as well as 15,000 subscribers.
Alex said the pair planned to target menopausal hot flushes in their next app.
HADDON DIXON 26, Melbourne Aircart founder The idea for Aircart — like Uber for groceries — came to Haddon Dixon out of necessity. “I arrived home from work about 7pm and opened up the fridge and there was nothing there,” he said.
The business student, who was also working full-time in logistics, wondered why he couldn’t get groceries delivered promptly and, without testing, set up a website offering such a service within southeast Melbourne.
His first order arrived within two hours of launch. Aircart now services “about 1000” customers who get groceries delivered in about 45 minutes, he said, and is in talks with “large-scale retailers” to expand its service later this year.
JOSEPH SINCLAIR 22, Melbourne Sprout app creator Thousands of Aussies are swapping and selling their backyard produce thanks to Joseph Sinclair, a student at Monash University, who created the Sprout app after inspiration on a New Zealand holiday.
The computer science student noticed “honesty boxes” filled with homegrown produce on his trip and decided to digitise them in an Apple app.
“For months I worked hard to get the app to a stage where it was good enough for uni, but over the next year I kept grinding to the point where it was usable by thousands of people,” he said.
The Sprout app now boasts more than 3000 users, and Mr Sinclair said he was working to launch a version for Android smartphones to reach more urban farmers, while pursuing a career in software development.
CHRIS DILGER 22, Melbourne Waterwise and Helping Group co-founder Whether it’s advising gardeners how to avoid “urban heat stress” or helping bushfire victims find safe places, Chris Dilger is determined to use technology for good.
The computer science graduate claimed the global Deloitte Australia-UK Gravity Challenge prize with Waterwise collaborator Amber Truong in December. Their creation — a platform to help consumers work out how much to water their garden and when based on environmental factors — will now be used in a pilot for water providers.
And the venture came after Mr Dilger set up an Amazon cloud infrastructure for the Helping Group, assisting bushfire victims connect with accommodation for themselves and livestock.
Their next project, he says, is a “digital democracy tool” to hold MPs accountable. “I think we have so much unrealised potential in this country,” he said.
CHARLIE CARRINGTON 27, Melbourne Atlas Masterclass co-founder When lockdowns hit the hospitality sector last year, restaurant owner Charlie Carrington devised an alternative plan. Rather than swap to takeaway fare for Atlas Dining, which he established at the age of 22, he proposed a food delivery service to help folks make the cuisine at home, accompanied by video instructions.
“It was a pretty out-there concept,” he said. “But the uptake was instant. It was incredible. We launched with no planning. I put an Instagram post up and said ‘email us’ and we had 50 emails in the first half an hour.” Just like the restaurant, the menu for Atlas Masterclass changes weekly, delivered with “pre-portioned” groceries, and is designed to be family friendly. The restaurant took 400 orders in its first week of launch and has remained popular, he said, employing 60 international staff during Melbourne’s lockdowns. Mr Carrington said he now planned to expand Masterclass to Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia.
“It’s a growing business and for us what started during COVID has proven to have the longevity,” he said. “Who would have thought something good and long-term could come from it?”
LACHLAN MATHESON 25, Melbourne BOXXD founder When Lachlan Matheson’s sister couldn’t buy boxes for her cake shop, the then-flight attendant stepped in to help, organising their manufacture overseas.
That assistance, and his idea for ready and custom-made packaging, has since turned into a lucrative online business turning over “$3m a year”.
“This was my first proper company. It was a little scary to transition from working somewhere else to putting a lot of money into something,” he said. “I had to buy a lot of stock, not knowing if we were going to have any customers.” His packaging company BOXXD now works with small and medium-sized businesses in Australia and more than 20 other countries to create packaging for all types of goods. After a spike in orders last year, Mr Matheson said the company planned to launch more pre-made packaging for e-commerce this year.
DANIELLE LEBON 29, Melbourne Co-Lab Pantry co-founder When the pandemic shutdown restaurants across Melbourne, Danielle Lebon, a design and marketing specialist, and friends Natasha Buttigeig, 29, and Avin Chadee, 28, devised a way to help them stay in business.
They set out to create a one-stop shop for meals, ingredients, sauces, recipes and merchandise, where users could order from many venues at once.
“There wasn’t any other company doing what we were doing and allowing customers to cross-purchase across different restaurants,” she said. “It took time to get their heads around it and for us to build that story for them.” It also took “20-hour days for the whole year,” Ms Lebon said, as the company grew to feature goods from more than 150 vendors across Victoria, and attracted close to 12,000 customers.
