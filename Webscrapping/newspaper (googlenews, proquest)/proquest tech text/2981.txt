A GLOBAL film company has teamed up with a South Australian university to offer new training in digital effects.
Technicolour Creative Studios will offer online courses from its North Tce studio, MPC, for Flinders University virtual production students.
A Flinders spokesman said the Oscar-winning visual effects company would need to hire hundreds of graduates as it scaled up in SA.
“So students having direct access to their training and recruiters will help ensure opportunities for roles,” he said.
In addition to the new industry partnership, Flinders was launching one of Australia’s first master of virtual production degrees, which would be taught in a purpose-built motion capture studio at its Bedford Park campus.
Flinders graduate Brittany Gallasch, pictured, said it was “so exciting for people wanting to get into the motion capture and virtual reality space”.
“You always hear of amazing virtual productions happening overseas, not in Australia, so it’s exciting to be part of the movement here in Adelaide,” she said.
“To be able to learn at Flinders with the same technology as Disney and Pixar to build a career in virtual production is amazing.” Instead of filming in live environments, virtual production uses LED screens and computer gaming engine technology to create digital backgrounds behind physical sets. Actors are lit by panels and walls.
MPC head of studio Alexandra Daunt Watney said Flinders graduates had been employed for its SA operation, which played a major role in recent movies Spider-Man: No Way Home and Finch.
“Not only are they creatively talented but genuinely lovely, well-rounded people,” Ms Daunt Watney said.
“At MPC Adelaide, we pride ourselves on the quality of the work we produce and our studio culture. “We can’t wait to welcome more Flinders alumni into our studio.”
