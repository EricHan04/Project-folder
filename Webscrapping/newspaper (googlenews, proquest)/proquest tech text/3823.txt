NEW Flinders University students Sebastian Reichelt and Christopher Radzikiewicz aim to tap into some of South Australia’s strongest growth sectors.
Mr Reichelt wants to work in maritime engineering while Mr Radzikiewicz is interested in robotics and automation, essential ingredients in advanced manufacturing.
The students, both 18, were given conditional offers to Flinders based on their Year 11 school results, but comfortably achieved Australian Tertiary Entrance Rank scores for Year 12 that would have got them into their chosen courses anyway.
“I’ve always loved the ocean and been a big fan of how boats work,” said Mr Reichelt, a graduate of Sacred Heart College.
“And I’ve always been interested in engineering and applying maths to real-life situations.” He looked at other courses in civil and structural engineering before homing in on the maritime course at Flinders.
“I got drawn to that with all we’ve got going on in Adelaide at the moment, with the submarine program and shipbuilding,” he said.
“Hopefully, I can get in there in a few years time.” Before that, he is expecting to spend a bit of time in the uni bar. “Hopefully, 2021 will be better than last year for that sort of thing,” he said. Mr Radzikiewicz, a graduate of St John’s Grammar School, was drawn to Flinders for its robotics engineering course.
“I like maths and I’ve always thought computers are pretty cool, so why not make moving computers,” he said.
While he has not settled on an exact career, he anticipates engineering will create many options. As a resident of the Hills, the ease of getting to Flinders was a plus, and he was looking forward to working at the Tonsley and Bedford Park campuses.
He expects one the biggest changes from school will be the extra freedom to choose how to structure his time.
