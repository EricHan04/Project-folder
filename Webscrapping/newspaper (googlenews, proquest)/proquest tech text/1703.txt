OPPORTUNITIES to grow South Australia’s AgTech sector will be top of the agenda for Primary Industries Minister Tim Whetstone who is travelling to Israel as part of an Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce Trade Mission.
AgTech has been identified by the State Government as a key growth area to help South Australian farmers boost agriculture to a $100 billion industry in Australia by 2030.“Israel has more than 750 active start-ups and companies operating in the food tech and AgTech sectors, so there are enormous opportunities to better understand how South Australia can benefit from greater adoption and commercialisation of technologies,” Mr Whetstone said.
