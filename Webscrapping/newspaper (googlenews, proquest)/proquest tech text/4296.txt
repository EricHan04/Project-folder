A SOFTWARE company that was started during the height of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown by two young entrepreneurs has just been valued at $4m.
Alex Millar and Santi Bravo launched Hudled in March last year as a software system to simplify and centralise company subscriptions.
Hudled, based in Sydney, allows a company to ditch a spreadsheet, with the technology syncing to an accounting system that monitors costs for services, such as point-of-sale technology, music and news subscriptions.
Born in the age of lockdowns and remote working, Hudled is now valued at $4m — with the intention of an “aggressive” expansion into the US market.
Mr Bravo, who received initial backing through venture capitalists Antler, went looking online in pursuit of a business partner. Responding to the Facebook post, Mr Millar quickly jumped on the opportunity.
“We met in person once for coffee, then Australia went into lockdown,” he said. Mr Millar said that five weeks after joining, Hudled was granted $155,000 in funding to scale up. In May last year, the company was valued at $1.5m, with the latest valuation sitting above $4m.
