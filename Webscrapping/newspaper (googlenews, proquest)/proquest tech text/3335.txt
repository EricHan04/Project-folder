The best in beef was celebrated at the 2018-19 Southern Grassfed Carcase Classic presentation dinner held in Penola earlier this month.
In its 11th year, the carcase competition held at Teys Australia's Naracoorte abattoir attracted a record 1619 entries from across SA and western Vic.
This was an extra 350 head than 2017-18, cementing the event as the nation's largest.
The SGCC is a great fundraiser for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and this year more than $27,000 was donated to the worthy cause.
During the dinner guests were able to put on virtual reality head sets from Meat & Livestock Australia and view a six-minute paddock to plate beef video.
It is aimed at showing consumers how Australian beef is produced.
Stock Journal's CATHERINE MILLER was there.
