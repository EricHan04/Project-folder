Matt Kean will on Thursday visit Tamworth to announce that 300km of transmission lines and 58 towers have been improved as part of a fast-tracked endeavour to upgrade the Queensland to NSW electricity interconnector.
Mr Kean, who is also Energy Minister, said consumers and producers would be better off thanks to the $236m project.
“We expect this priority project to provide net benefits of $170 million to electricity customers and producers,” he said.
“It will help to reduce electricity bills for households and provide a more reliable and affordable energy supply for the people who live, work and play in NSW.”
The $170m figure came from a cost-benefit analysis of the project and was calculated across the lifespan of the interconnector.
The upgraded Queensland-NSW interconnector will allow for more efficient sharing of electricity between the two states, which officials hope will put downward pressure on prices.
That’s because the supply will be more reliable, including during peak demand.
Mr Kean said he also hoped the upgrades could pave the way for a transition to greater use of renewable energy.
“The interconnector upgrades will support the development of renewable generation in new energy zones across both states, as coal-fired generators retire and we transition towards a grid predominantly supplied by renewable energy sources,” Mr Kean said.
The upgrades were fast-tracked after the NSW and federal governments joined together to underwrite the project at a cost of $102 million.
But there were still delays, which NSW officials blamed on Covid-19.
Construction began in May 2020, and delays in supplying key equipment pushed the finishing date from March 2022 to late July.
