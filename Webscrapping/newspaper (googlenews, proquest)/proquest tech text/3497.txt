Just 12 months since a bushfire tore through Keilira, Kingston District Council has launched Wind Dance, the first augmented-reality public mural in South Australia.
The project was made possible thanks to funding from the Regional Tourism Bushfire Recovery Program, a federal government bushfire recovery initiative.
"We know that a strong tourism sector has many benefits: it creates jobs, investment and growth, especially in the regions," project founder and council chief executive officer Nat Traeger said.
"We sought funding with the intention of stimulating our economy through innovation and having a point of difference.
"We wanted to create an experience that is unique to Kingston and provides a new tourism offering to draw people into our main street precinct."
Mayor Kay Rasheed said council was immediately drawn to the possibility of augmenting a public artwork due to it not being done in South Australia before.
"We first saw the augmented reality concept whilst developing our new Public Art Framework, and we were interested in pursuing the idea of having something in our town," she said.
"The project will capitalise on the growth of both art tourism and the world of augmented reality and we are excited to see this literally come to life."
People can download the free 'EyeJack' app to see the huge mural come to life.
With tourism rapidly growing in regional SA, council hopes the artwork will bring more people to the region, in turn supporting local businesses and bringing small rural communities together.
