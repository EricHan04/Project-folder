Under the new arrangement with energy provider ENGIE Australia & New Zealand, Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane buildings – including 115 schools and family services sites – will soon be powered by green electricity.
Brisbane Catholic Education deputy executive director Doug Ashleigh said the long-term electricity supply agreement, which comes with zero net carbon certification, was a crucial step in the sector meeting its renewable energy goals.
“We educate our students about the importance of environmental sustainability, so it is great to show that we are modelling this by moving to renewable energy sources to power our schools,” Dr Ashleigh said.
He said he also considered it a “win for school budgets”, due to the reduced power costs.
Among the schools set to make the switch was St Augustine’s College in Greater Springfield, putting the school well ahead of schedule to meet the entire city’s target of 100 per cent renewable power by 2038.
Archdiocese of Brisbane property and building director Patrick Lane-Mullins described the move as a “great step forward in reducing our carbon footprint”.
“It will result in the majority of the larger energy-consuming assets being not only under the single service provider, but also being 100% renewable,” he said.
ENGIE ANZ has multiple wind farms across the country as well as solar and gas projects.
Executive general manager Andrew Hyland said the company was working with a diverse range of businesses to go green, and the deal with BCE should serve as an example to other education authorities.
“Schools and public buildings are at the centre of our communities and play an important role in leading our net zero energy transition,” he said.
