TEN SA school students have space on their mind as they head to the US this week to represent the state at the FIRST LEGO League world championships in Detroit.
The RoboRoos East team – aged 10-15 and part of the Student Robotics Club of SA – will compete with more than 100 teams from around the world from April 24-27.
Inspired by a talk given by former astronaut Pamela Melroy, also an ex-NASA space shuttle commander who now calls Adelaide home, the team has developed a solution that could help astronauts overcome lack of sleep and back pain experienced in space.
Their solution – a pressured sleep suit that enables astronauts to comfortably sleep, in a position of their choice with the support needed to mimic the earth’s gravitational force and alleviate back pain – will be presented at the competition.
Last year, the RoboRoos East team scooped first place for Innovative Solution at the FIRST LEGO League world championships in Houston, Texas.
The FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a collaboration between Lego and FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), an international organisation that promotes STEM (science, engineering, technology and maths). The event attracts more than 300,000 students from around the world each year. SA Roboroo Jack Hutchins said it was his third event. “FLL has opened my eyes to robotics. I especially enjoy solving engineering problems, working in a team and meeting people from around the globe in the process,” he said.
Isabella Dharam, one of three girls on the team and a seasoned LEGO League competitor, said FLL was a great opportunity to meet new people and learn about different topics like space while working as a team.Another team member Chaya Balasuriya said: “We are all very different but we all speak FLL”.
