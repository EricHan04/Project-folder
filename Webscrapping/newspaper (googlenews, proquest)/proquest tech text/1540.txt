Five innovative agricultural technology developers from across Australia have won an opportunity to pitch directly to an estimated 500-strong audience at SA's premier agtech conference AdvanceAg next week to win $10,000.
The inaugural Macro Meats AgTech 'Pitch to Farmers' competition finalists are Winely and Bio Optics Australia from SA, Onside and Farmbot Monitoring Solutions from NSW, and Bitwise Agronomy from Tas.
Primary Industries Minister David Basham said many people were looking forward to attending AdvanceAg on October 17-18 after the rescheduling of the event due to COVID-19 restrictions, with a big crowd expected at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
"This year we have focused on having technology providers present with a farmer who uses their technology as a way to encourage greater adoption of tech on-farm in SA," he said.
