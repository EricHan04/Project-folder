Australia will play a key role in establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon, after striking an agreement with the United States' civilian space programme for an Australian-made rover to be part of future missions.
Nasa is aiming to return humans to the Moon as soon as 2024 to build a strategic presence at the Artemis Base Camp - a permanent outpost at the lunar south pole - which will pave the way for long-term scientific activity as well as the first human mission to Mars in the 2030s.
The federal government will support Australian businesses and researchers to develop the semi-autonomous robot through its A$50 million (NZ$53m) Trailblazer programme.
The rover will be sent to collect lunar soil that contains oxides. Using separate equipment, Nasa will aim to extract oxygen from the soil.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was an opportunity for Australia to succeed in a global space sector that is forecast to be worth more than US$1 trillion (NZ$1.44t) by 2040.
Under the agreement, Nasa will fly the rover to the Moon as early as 2026, provided it meets a range of conditions during its development.
Greater collaboration in space will form another part of the new AUKUS security pact between the US, Australia and Britain.
The federal government has invested more than A$700m (NZ$741m) in Australia's civil space sector since July 2018, supporting core industries including manufacturing, robotics, engineering, mining and resources. The Australian Space Agency opened its headquarters in Adelaide last year.
Head of the Australian Space Agency, former Virgin Galactic chief Enrico Palermo, said the mission would demonstrate the Australian industry's world- leading skills and experience in remote operations, drawing on expertise in the resources and mining sector. - Nine
