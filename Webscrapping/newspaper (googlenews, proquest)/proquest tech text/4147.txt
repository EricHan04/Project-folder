LITTLE Heroes Foundation has raised close to $20 million for lifesaving facilities at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Founder and chair Chris McDermott speaks about the cause closest to his heart.
What is the cause you support and why?
Little Heroes Foundation supports children with serious illness and their families throughout SA and the NT. We began as McGuinness McDermott Foundation over 23 years ago after Tony (McGuinness) and I met two very sick young boys, Nicholas McLean and Nathan Berry.
Sadly they are no longer with us but the Foundation is here to say thanks to them for their courage in very tough times.
How has the NDIS affected the work you do?
It hasn’t. We have rebuilt wards and bought new equipment for the WCH here in Adelaide including a couple of MRIs, the Michael Rice Centre and a Centre for Robotics and Innovation.
Any major fundraisers/events coming up this year that people/businesses can participate in/contribute to?
Always. That is primarily the way we make our money. We do not receive any government funds as a rule and the corporate market is a tough one to crack at the moment.
We recently auctioned our Finesse Built house at North Brighton and will hold the Anna Meares Golf Classic at Royal Adelaide in November.
How many staff and volunteers do you have?
We have two full time, and five part time plus about 10 regular volunteers. What is your opinion of the NFP sector in SA?It’s a competitive market. Everyone is aware of the challenges we face and are willing to join forces and work together when and where possible.
