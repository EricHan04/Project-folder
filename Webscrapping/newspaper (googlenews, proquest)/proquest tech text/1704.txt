A NEW agricultural technology advisory group is being set up by the State Government, with nominations now being sought.
The group will be made up of eight members, including an independent chair, and provide advice on the adoption of on-farm technologies and innovation.
Agtech has been identified as a key area to help farmers grow agriculture to a $100 billion industry by 2030.
Primary Industries Minister Tim Whetstone, pictured, encouraged anyone with experience and interest in agtech in South Australia to nominate for the group.
“There are enormous opportunities to grow the agtech sector in South Australia but we need a co-ordinated and focused approach to grasp the opportunities before us,” he said.
“The role of this group is vital to encourage greater adoption of agtech solutions on-farm and through the value chain. It will help to build on South Australia’s advantages, showcase businesses and organisations developing or using new technology, and to increase productivity in our primary industries. Some of the key areas the panel will look at include overcoming barriers that may be preventing producers from adopting new or emerging technologies, commercialisation and focusing on a long-term strategy to grow agtech in South Australia.
“We are seeking people who are leaders in their fields from research and academia, the entrepreneurial community, and individuals from across primary industry sectors, notably in grains, horticulture, meat and livestock. If we want to grow and improve the way we do business, it’s critical we embrace technology and apply the latest knowledge and practices. This advisory group will assist South Australia to be a technology leader.”Nominations for the group can be made through www.pir.sa/agtech and close May 13.
