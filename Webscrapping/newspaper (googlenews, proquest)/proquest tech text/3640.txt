HITCH a ride on a drone and fly over an “active” volcano – Mount Schank near Mount Gambier – then hike around the rim and view it in full 360-degree panoramic glory.
The virtual tour now taking shape is the first in a series highlighting South Australia’s best geological sites. UniSA Associate Professor Tom Raimondo loves bringing landscapes to life with virtual and augmented reality, without detracting from the real thing.
“We actually see this as a really effective tool to encourage people to go out into the field,” he said. “If you see something like this, with the drone footage and the 3D models, the hope is that you might just find the spark to say ‘I want to go and see this for myself’.” As director of Project LIVE (Learning through Immersive Virtual Environments), Dr Raimondo wants to reach out to students studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics, at school and university, as well as tourists and the public.During National Science Week, he was named South Australia’s STEM Educator of the Year (Tertiary). Dr Raimondo said “students who have never even contemplated visiting some of these sites are suddenly saying ‘that looks really cool’.”
