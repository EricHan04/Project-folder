THE LIVESTOCK sector gathered at Kapunda on Thursday to engage in a series discussions about the exciting future for producers with technology implementation.
Delivered by the Red Meat and Wool Growth Program, a plethora of speakers highlighted some of the sector's success stories and areas for improvement to evoke renewed motivation.
To help explain the role of AgTech in improving business performance, ProAdvice Services Chris Scheid gave producers a look into how to crunch numbers and make a better profit and Achieve Agriculture Solutions Nathan Scott asked the room whether or not eID was the way forward and if so, how to get it happening on-farm in the near future.
AgTech adoption can be more attainable for some producers and Keyneton Station's Georgie Keynes explained how their family operation has introduced it bit-by-bit.
Australian Wool Innovation's Emily King presented a detailed explanation of the shearing shed design project and despite being challenged by a few producers in the room about its practicality, it was largely taken on board.
Stock Journal's VANESSA BINKS went along to listen in on what's happening in the sector.
