Nominations are being sought for a new Ministerial AgTech Advisory Group, as part of the State Government's concerted focus to grow primary industries in South Australia.
The AgTech Advisory Group will be made up of eight members, including an independent chair, and provide high-level independent advice on the practical application and adoption of technologies and on-farm innovation.
AgTech has been identified as a key growth area to help farmers boost agriculture to a $100 billion industry in Australia by 2030.
Minister for Primary Industries and Regional Development Tim Whetstone encouraged anyone with experience and interest in AgTech in South Australia to nominate for the advisory group.
"We are seeking people who are leaders in their fields from research and academia, the entrepreneurial community, and individuals from across primary industry sectors, notably in grains, horticulture, meat and livestock.
"If we want to grow and improve the way we do business, it's critical we embrace technology and apply the latest knowledge and practices.
"This advisory group will assist South Australia to be a technology leader."
The Advisory Group will complement existing State Government strategies and investments in entrepreneurship, which aim to foster collaboration.
Nominations for the AgTech Advisory Group open on 11 April 2019 and close 13 May 2019.
