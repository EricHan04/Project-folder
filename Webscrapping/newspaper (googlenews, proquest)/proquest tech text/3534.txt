NOCTURNAL playgrounds of giant inflatable sculptures, pixels and projections will transform three CBD precincts into a City Lights spectacle for the Illuminate Adelaide festival in July.
More than 40 site-specific works will shed fresh light on North Terrace as well as in the East End and West End from July 16 to August 1.
Illuminate artistic directors Rachael Azzopardi and Lee Cumberlidge said the winter festival would showcase another side of the state’s arts as creative industries collaborated with cultural institutions.
“On North Terrace, there will be things at Lot 14, the art gallery, the museum, the library,” Ms Azzopardi said.
Another dozen City Lights attractions will be featured along Rundle Mall and Rundle Street, including the Sky Castle – a deconstructed rainbow of inflatable arches, pictured left – by Australian design company ENESS.
In the West End, from Hindley Street to Light Square, the Big Picture Series will blend street art with augmented reality.
Ms Azzopardi said people could immerse themselves in the innovation of Adelaide’s creative industries, including animation and visual effects companies such as Monkeystack and Rising Sun Pictures. “We really wanted to bring those practitioners or companies out into the public realm,” she said.
Illuminate was also about exploring, Mr Cumblerlidge said: “We’re working with all the cultural institutions, various galleries and all kinds of other public spaces to transform the city.” The full Illuminate Adelaide program, featuring more than 150 installations, performances and events, will be released in May.
