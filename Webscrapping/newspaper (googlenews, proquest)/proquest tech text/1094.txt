The Australian-based global asset management business that manages $US180bn of assets on behalf of investors such as institutions and pension funds is vying for the business along with Palisade Investment Partners.
Palisade is working in a consortium to acquire GeelongPort with Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, advised by Gresham.
The port is for sale through Barrenjoey Capital Partners and Macquarie Capital on behalf of owners Brookfield and State Super.
Final bids are due on December 10.
First Sentier has been active in the mergers and acquisitions space when it comes to infrastructure in Australia, with a particular interest in renewable energy.
Last year it purchased John Laing’s Australian wind farms for $285m.
Also in the contest to buy the port until recently was Australian infrastructure investor ICG, advised by Rothschild, but it has since walked away.
The port at Corio Bay in Victoria is the country’s sixth largest based on tonnage and handles over 600 vessel visits annually, with the majority of the shipping linked to the bulk liquid berth at Refinery Pier.
Commodities going through the port include crude oil and petroleum products from Viva Energy’s Geelong refinery at Corio Bay, export grain and woodchips, alumina imports and fertiliser. Some funds are said to be shying away over fossil fuel concerns.
The Port of Geelong generates $60m of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the hope of Brookfield and State Super is that it will sell for between 20 and 30 times EBITDA as interest rates remain low and demand for infrastructure assets is strong.
The remaining 50 per cent shareholding of Port of Portland, a deep water port located between Melbourne and Adelaide, was purchased by Palisade in 2018 from the Utilities Trust of Australia in 2018. At that time, the price paid was about 11 times EBITDA.
