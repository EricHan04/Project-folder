THE Federal Government will retain the same eftpos-to-cash ratio as the BasicsCard in its cashless debit card when the system is introduced in the NT this year.
Federal Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston explained on ABC Radio the card will retain the 50 per cent eftpos, 50 per cent cash ratio of the BasicsCard, after concerns were raised over the potential impacts of the card having the 80 per cent eftpos, 20 per cent cash ratio which applies to other states.
“The cashless debit card will replace the BasicsCard at the rate at which the BasicsCard is for the individual,” she said.
“The legislation requires us to do that.” The cashless debit card is currently used in certain areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.
Ms Ruston said it was a vast improvement to the Basics -Card, which was introduced in 2007. “You can use the CD card at any outlet that’s got an eftpos as long as it’s not an outlet with blocked products,” she said. “The only difference between a CD card and a normal eftpos card is you will be blocked from buying alcohol, gambling products and taking cash out.” The card still allows for cigarettes to be purchased.“The main reason the cashless debit card was introduced is about the harm to the community,” Ms Ruston said.
