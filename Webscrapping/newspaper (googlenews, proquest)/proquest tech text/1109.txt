Fiona Madeleine Daws & Nigel Francis Griffin Married at Adelaide Zoo, Adelaide
WHEN planning his proposal to Fiona, Nigel had orchestrated the most romantic weekend away.
The planned hot air balloon ride was cancelled due to weather, but that didn’t stop him from pulling out all the stops.
In their own private room at 1918 Bistro & Grill over a delicious dinner, Nigel asked Fiona to spend the rest of her life with him.
“I was so excited and could not say yes to my amazing man fast enough,” she says. “Finally, the man of my dreams has asked me to marry him.” Fiona’s son, Jack Daws, walked her down the aisle at Adelaide Zoo before the ceremony with celebrant Rachel Parsens.
Afterwards, 60 guests enjoyed a guided tour of the zoo, including tiger and giraffe feeding.
Then they celebrated at a reception where the Oakden couple cut into a cake by The Cake Studio Adelaide.
The bride couldn’t be more thrilled to now be married to Nigel, the owner of Griffin Renewable Energy.
“Nigel has turned my life into a fairytale, he is the most romantic wonderful man,” she says.
Fiona wore a sparkling Bridal Emporium gown, with a veil with diamante accents and platform sneakers blinged out in silver.
The matron of honour was the bride’s daughter Rosie Daws and bridesmaid was Gemma Crossland.
The best man was Graham Dumont and groomsman Mick Hyett.
Friend and “amazing” photographer Karen Beckman, of Champagne Portraits, captured their special memories.
The couple met via Tinder and had their first date at Jamie Oliver’s restaurant in the city in May 2017.
