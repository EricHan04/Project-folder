SA sheep and cattle producers will be offered $10,000 state government grants to embrace AgTech on farm and enable use of data-based livestock management to grow profitability.
The Livestock AgTech Rebate is part of the $7.5 million Red Meat and Wool Growth Program and is designed to encourage livestock producers to invest in new technology and obtain the necessary training and support to implement it successfully.
Primary Industries Minister David Basham said the rebate scheme was designed to increase livestock sector productivity and profitability.
"The funds will support adoption of electronic identification equipment such as walk-over weighing systems, panel readers and auto drafters or remote monitoring sensors for water points and soil," he said.
"On-farm AgTech is a key component for the future growth of our red meat and wool sectors particularly as the SA Beef Industry Blueprint indicates only one in five beef producers currently achieve greater than five per cent return on assets.
"The rebate will support producers to implement priorities identified in their farm AgTech plans developed through Livestock Enterprise Planning sessions.
"Following feedback received during recent drought forums, a rebate for pregnancy scanning services for sheep is also included in the scheme.
"Current research shows 74pc of SA's sheep producers do not currently undertake pregnancy scanning, one of the lowest rates in the country.
"As pregnancy scanning significantly assists with increasing lambing percentages, leading to improved productivity along with the obvious welfare benefits, it is important that we encourage uptake of this technology to assist with the rebuild of the state's flock."
Applications for the Livestock AgTech Rebate will close at 5pm on March 31, 2022 or whenever the funding allocation is exhausted, whichever occurs first.
