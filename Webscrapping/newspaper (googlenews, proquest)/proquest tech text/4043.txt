GRAINGROWERS who attended the Southern Australia Durum Growers Association's annual event late last month were granted unique access to the San Remo milling facility.
Attendees also toured the University of Adelaide's Waite campus to view the breeding centre and witness robotics at work in the plant accelerator.
Forum speakers included University of Adelaide durum breeder Jason Able, who spoke about the performance of durum varieties Artemis and Spes, while San Remo's grain research coordinator Fil Ciancio discussed milling qualities of new durum varieties.
SADGA chairman Simon Mildren hoped the interactive program created a renewed interest in growing high quality durum wheat.
