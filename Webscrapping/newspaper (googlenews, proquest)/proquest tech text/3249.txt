THERE is no sign of the DeLorean from Back to the Future - but a new innovation hub in Adelaide’s northwest has showcased tricks that would make Marty McFly and Dr Emmett “Doc” Brown proud.
The Motor Trade Association and has joined forces with a Sydney based tech company, Tradiebot, to supercharge the motoring industry with new technology.
Students are learning to spray paint vehicles with virtual reality googles, augmented reality will help others fix a motor for the first time without the need for a thick service manual and a 3D printer is creating customised fixes for broken headlights.
MTA chief executive, Paul Unerkov said the innovation hub would be the core of delivering new skills, training and advancing technologies to the current and future workforce.
The training centre will also be used as a tool to entice more young South Australians into the industry that is in desperate need of more workers.
“The centre will showcase the latest in automotive innovation to schools and students, allowing them to see the latest technologies being used and developed in the automotive service and repair space,” he said. “This will provide a new perspective to the trade and demonstrate the stimulating career interest in our industry that is starving for new, fresh talent.” First year MTA apprentice Aaron Egan said the technology was great to showcase where the industry was headed.The 20-year-old from Mawson Lakes used virtual reality googles to practice spray-painting a car. “Being able to practice the technique, and being able to see where you are covering and where you are not, is great,” he said. Amber Jones, a 19-year-old first year apprentice agreed: “It is awesome to have this sort of technology ready and available to us.”
