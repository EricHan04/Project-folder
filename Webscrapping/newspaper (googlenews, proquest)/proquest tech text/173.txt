PREMIER Peter Malinauskas has told Extinction Rebellion protesters, who marred the first day of an oil and gas conference at Adelaide Convention Centre, that they should take into account the state’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.
Two protesters, both grandmothers, were arrested for loiterng and dozens more attempted to block the centre’s entrance, but police were there in force to stop them.
Two other protesters, a retired psychologist and a retired school teacher, glued their hands to the footpath in front of the centre’s western entrance. Both were removed by police and given a cease loitering warning.
Energy and Mining Minister Tom Koutsantonis was part of a panel that kicked off the Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition.
Mr Malinauskas said the protesters should consider South Australia’s energy production in context, pointing out 54 per cent of electricity nationally was from coal, but zero per cent in SA.
“The fact that South Australia is the national leader when it comes to decarbonisation is something we can be proud of in the context of us pulling our weight addressing climate change, but just as excitingly it means massive economic opportunity,” he said, pointing to his government’s hydrogen agenda.
“We now have 68 per cent of all energy that is produced in SA comes from renewable energy, well in excess of the national average.” Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman Peta Page demanded the state government end all oil and gas industry partnerships. Extinction Rebellion said in a statement its action would continue on Tuesday with “new disruptive tactics” starting on the Adelaide Oval footbridge in the morning.
