IN a win for “space diplomacy” it is great news that Space Fest will go ahead for the third year in a row in South Australia, especially against the backdrop of coronavirus disruptions.
It’s likely to be an even bigger opportunity for SA’s space companies and researchers this year given the $7 billion in space investment flagged in Scott Morrison’s $270 billion 10-year defence strategy last week.
The event is a showcase held at Woomera of how well companies and researchers can detect and track objects in space.
It will help Defence identify who could take part in cutting-edge research and multibillion-dollar projects in the pipeline, which could ultimately mean more jobs and investment for SA.
A deal with Japan to bolster co-operation between the two countries’ space agencies is also likely to be good news for SA’s growing space sector. Japan is considered a leader in robotics and has the fifth largest space program in the world. The country pumps about $3 billion a year into space research. When borders reopen, this space diplomacy could also draw more international researchers to SA.
