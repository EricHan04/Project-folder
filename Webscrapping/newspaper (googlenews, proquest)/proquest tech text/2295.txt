ENERGYAUSTRALIA, the nation’s third largest electricity company, suffered a crash in first-half earnings while warning pressure would remain on household power bills amid ongoing volatility in global fuel prices.
The power giant’s operating earnings slumped to a loss of $HK8.6bn ($1.6bn) for the six months to June 30, compared with a $146m profit a year earlier, after it locked in hedge contracts at lower levels than a recent jump in wholesale prices.
Generation shortfalls from its Yallourn and Mount Piper coal plants meant it had to buy expensive supplies in the market to still meet customer contracts and it plunged to a $HK7.96bn loss on the hedging contracts.
The Melbourne-based company, owned by Hong Kong’s CLP Group, had previously disclosed a profit warning six weeks ago where it laid out the bulk of the fair value loss of its energy hedging contracts.
The EnergyAustralia hit meant CLP fell to a $HK4.86bn loss for the half from a $HK4.62bn profit a year ago.
Excluding the hedging loss, CLP saw group operating earnings fall by a quarter to $HK4.1bn, due to a worse Australian performance and continued high coal prices.
It expects high international energy prices to remain volatile, adding pressure on household bills, amid a move to renewable sources of supply.
“Volatility in spot prices in response to weather variations and changes in supply and demand looks set to continue amid the net-zero transition in Australia,” CLP said.
EnergyAustralia signed a $1bn credit facility in July to provide a bigger financial buffer for its operations. The company’s credit rating on July 6 was lowered by S&P to BBB- with a negative outlook due to its weakening credit position.EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn station in Victoria supplies 8 per cent of the national electricity market, but has been under pressure for several years as Australia’s national power grid accelerates a transition to renewable energy.
