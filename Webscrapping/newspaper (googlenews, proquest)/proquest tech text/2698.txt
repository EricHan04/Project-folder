GFG’s chief restructuring officer Jeffrey S. Stein said in a statement that a number of recent developments would help pave the way for a refinancing, which would enable GFG to pay back its creditors.
“We are aware of the significant challenges facing the group but are pleased that we are making good progress to refinance, repay creditors and refocus the group on our core assets,’’ he said.
“Much remains to be done but we are optimistic that a vibrant, well-funded, profitable and sustainable business will emerge as we systematically restructure and transform the group.”
The company said late on Monday that it will refocus on “core business units” including the Australian operations, which include Liberty Primary Metals Australia which owns the Whyalla steelworks.
GFG said achievements to date by the Liberty Steel Group Restructuring and Transformation Committee (RTC), included:
– GFG Alliance and Credit Suisse Asset Management (CSAM) agreeing to a formal standstill agreement with regard to LPMA, as previously reported, which will enable the business to complete full refinancing
– progressing the refinancing of LPMA with White Oak Global Advisers. The refinancing will be sufficient to pay out LPMA’s Greensill debt, said to be $430m, in full – agreement on a framework with Greensill Bank’s administrators for positive direct engagement to achieve an amicable resolution
– submission of refinancing memoranda to interested parties for Liberty Steel Continental Europe, including major primary production hubs in Ostrava and Galati.
– development of new business plans, an asset strategy and management structure for Liberty Steel UK
“Since May, the RTC has evolved a strategy for Liberty’s future which will see the company focus on its primary metal production hubs and associated downstream units, and renewable energy developments, to support its Greensteel vision,’’ GFG said.
“The restructuring will support GFG’s progress on refinancing of the group, which has been boosted by the strength of core assets and record steel, aluminium and iron ore prices.
“In its reformed state, Liberty will be focused on core business units, including InfraBuild and Liberty Primary Metals Australia (LPMA) in Australia and the Liberty Ostrava and Liberty Galati steelworks in Europe.
