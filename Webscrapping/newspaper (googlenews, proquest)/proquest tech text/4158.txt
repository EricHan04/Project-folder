BAE Systems has partnered with Flinders University in a $2.9 million program to develop manufacturing technologies in support of the $35 billion Future Frigates Program.
The funding will create seven research positions at Flinders digital test and trial collaboration hub at Tonsley.
They will work on new digital technologies, including advanced robotics and assistive manufacturing, which will provide real-time insights into shipyard and supply chain performance, leading to enhanced productivity, safety and quality outcomes.
Flinders vice-chancellor Colin Stirling said the university’s research expertise in advanced manufacturing would help to ensure the Hunter-class frigates would be built using world-leading technologies.“Our strengths in industry … and cutting-edge digital laboratories will enable the development and testing of bespoke technologies to advance the specialised construction processes required for this nationally significant project,” Professor Stirling said.
