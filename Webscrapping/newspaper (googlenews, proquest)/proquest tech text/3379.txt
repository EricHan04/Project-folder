AUSTRALIAN Dance Theatre will upload a virtual performance of its show Colony on the internet after it had to cancel this weekend’s performance because of major-event bans.
Colony, originally part of the 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art at the Art Gallery, will instead be filmed at The Odeon at Norwood and put online free next week.
It follows the national ban on all non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people. ADT executive director Nick Hays said among the reasons for filming work was lifting spirits at an uneasy time.
“Even though the current situation is incredibly stressful and disruptive, all of us at ADT believe wholeheartedly that this is not insurmountable,” Mr Hays said.
He said the company would also work with the Art Gallery about how Colony could be incorporated into its collection.
Hartstone-Kitney Productions artistic director Joanne Hartstone is investigating using a 3D camera to film performances then put them online, possibly for a fee.
“There is a lot of things to work out but it is important that … we engage the community somehow,” she said.
Premier and Arts Minister Steven Marshall said rather than “whinge, whine, moan and catastrophise” that there were no public performances in the state, the Government would look at new ways to show off work and keep companies afloat.
That could be via traditional film, pay-per-view and even virtual reality.“We can experiment … so we can improve the capability of the arts sector in terms of running businesses going forward,” Mr Marshall said.
