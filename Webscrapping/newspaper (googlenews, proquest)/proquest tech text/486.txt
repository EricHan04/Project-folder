ENERGY AUSTRALIAN industry faces significant spikes in power bills once existing electricity contracts expire, Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn has warned.
In comments made on the sidelines of a CBA conference on sustainability in Sydney, Mr Comyn said the world was facing an energy crunch due to the geopolitical crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
There were also the longer term cost implications of the transition to more renewable energy.
Mr Comyn (pictured) said price increases in electricity in domestic wholesale markets were now feeding into retail markets.
“There are business customers who are currently on very attractive current electricity prices which have been negotiated for them,” he said, adding that they faced “very substantial increases” in prices once they had to renegotiate new supply contracts.
Mr Comyn said expectations of a 56 per cent rise in the price of electricity in Australia in this week’s budget were much smaller than hikes of more than 600 per cent faced by companies in Germany. While not supportive of calls for the government to provide financial support to compensate people for higher electricity prices, Mr Comyn said the government faced challenges in deciding whether to intervene in the energy market to try to rein in price rises.
