An egg recall has been announced following the discovery of a salmonella outbreak at a Victorian egg farm.
A salmonella scare has prompted a recall of some brands of eggs from outlets in four states.
Five cases of salmonella enteritidis have been linked to eggs produced by Victoria's Bridgewater Poultry, the state's health department said on Thursday.
The company's free-range and barn-laid eggs are packaged as Woolworths brand, Victorian Fresh, and Loddon Valley, with best-before dates ranging from March 20 to April 29.
They are on shelves in Victoria, NSW, Tasmania and South Australia.
All other eggs are safe to eat, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said.
“It is important to know that not all eggs are affected, but any eggs carrying the listed brands should return them to the point of sale for a full refund. 
"Alternatively, they can be discarded by throwing them into the garbage, not the garden or compost.
“These eggs should not be given to pets or livestock.”
Vulnerable people, including the elderly, are urged to avoid eating raw egg products.
