An anticipated rocket launch on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula has again been delayed after the rocket caught fire — but the company involved says the blaze was contained to the launch pad.
The fire was sparked during the ignition phase of the lift-off attempt just after 4:00pm today at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln.
The failed launch prompted a call to the Country Fire Service (CFS), resulting in about 10 firefighters attending.
In a tweet, rocket-launching company Southern Launch said the rocket suffered "an internal fault causing it to catch alight" during ignition.
"The fire was contained to the pad & attended to by the CFS," the tweet read.
"No people or the environment were at risk."
ABC journalist Jodie Hamilton told ABC Local Radio she was waiting for the launch at about 4:00pm when she received a message saying it had been aborted.
"Then we got a call from a couple of farmers to say, 'We've seen some flames & we've seen some smoke,'" she said.
"We've raced up to the top of a hill to have a look and there was some smoke there."
A witness, who did not want to be named, told the ABC they saw black smoke coming out from the rocket stand.
"And a few moments later there was a large bang & some white smoke went up & then later some steam," they said.
"… There was certainly quite a bit of noise & a lot of smoke."
Southern Launch has been trying to conduct a test flight of Taiwanese company TiSPACE's 10.2-metre, two-stage orbital rocket Hapith I over the past week, but the launch has been plagued by weather delays.
Yesterday's attempted launch was halted just before lift-off because one of the rocket's systems did not come online.
