The alluring sounds of the Australian String Quartet will drift through Lot Fourteen today, when the doors to its rehearsal are thrown open at the precinct.
Music lovers can watch the quartet prepare for upcoming concerts and recordings, and stay for a performance.
Lot Fourteen state project lead Diane Dixon said this would be the ASQ’s third show at the precinct.
“Creative industries is one of the focus sectors at our precinct, which is home to Artisan Post Group, virtual reality specialist Jumpgate VR, infrastructure visualisation company Convergen and film producers Dancing Road Productions,” she said.
“Welcoming the ASQ for such a unique event is a perfect fit with our vision for this precinct and highlights the many opportunities to collaborate, engage and share spaces.” Viola player Stephen King said: “Sharing an experience in a space with creative people is central to what we do as artists.” The open rehearsal will be in the Eleanor Harrald Building lecture theatre, from noon to 5pm.
