MOTORISTS can soon use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to pay for fuel and other in-store purchases.
Convenience giant OTR plans to become Australia’s biggest crypto-accepting bricks-and-mortar retailer.
In a sign of digital currencies entering the mainstream, 170 OTR outlets in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia will begin accepting crypto payments from July.
OTR’s parent company Peregrine Corporation will accept crypto at its C Coffee, Subway, Oporto and Wokinabox outlets, and at its Smokemart and Giftbox stores.
Peregrine is working with Singapore company Crypto.com and merchant payments platform DataMesh to roll out new crypto-enabled point-of-sale terminals across its retail network.
Crypto.com manages digital wallets and operates one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.
The launch of the Crypto.com pay merchant service will allow OTR customers to pay with their cryptocurrency holdings via the Crypto.com app, with real-time conversion into dollars.
A merchant fee of 0.5 per cent is charged to the vendor, while the fee paid by customers will depend on the exchange rate at the time.
While most of Peregrine’s OTR stores are in SA, it has several outlets in regional Victoria, and this month opened its first store in Melbourne, in Alphington.
Executive chairman Yasser Shahin said his company was responding to the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies.
“The growth and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency adoption in Australia and the rest of the world has been phenomenal,” he said.
A Crypto.com survey found 60 per cent of merchants were interested in accepting crypto payments, but only 4 per cent had the capability. giuseppe.tauriello@news.com.au
