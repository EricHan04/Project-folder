Question of the week
This week's question Have you introduced agtech into your operation in recent years?
Yes No Last week's results Do you think buffalo meat, such as in burgers, could find a home in the Australian diet?
Yes.........................................................86pc No..........................................................14pc EDITORIAL JUST this week I had a new piece of research turn up in my inbox looking at how outside influences can help people make decisions. The gist was the majority of people prefer to take direct advice from an expert, while there are other people who will observe and learn from other's experiences.
It seems quite relevant this week, considering the discussions being had about why people do or do not choose to employ agtech options on their farms.
I've read - and even written - quite a few stories about somebody making a big change on their farm after hearing about the success someone else had. There are also quite a number of stories about the decision being made after taking advice from a trusted person, such as an agronomist or stock agent.
There are quite a few reasons why people might be reluctant to make big changes on the farm - with a big financial outlay and no assurance it's the right choice, a pretty convincing one. But there are also some challenges, such as labour shortages, that pose an equally convincing argument for change.
More and more we are hearing that following some massive jumps in production in recent decades, the next increases are going to come from agtech.
The key is making sure farmers feel confident and can trust the advice they receive.
