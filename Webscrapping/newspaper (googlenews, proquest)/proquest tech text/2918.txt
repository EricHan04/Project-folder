NEW mapping technology billed as a powerful world-first tool to reduce bushfire risk will be unveiled by an Adelaide company today.
Aerial-mapping specialist Aerometrex has developed the service, able to determine exact fuel-load densities in any bushfire-prone region.
CONTINUED PAGE 6 HI-TECH TOOL IN BATTLE FROM PAGE 1 Aerometrex managing director Mark Deuter said the Glynde-based company was working with major firefighting agencies across the country to provide the service to their fire management and risk-assessment modelling.
Interest is also expected from the insurance sector, as well as councils in bushfire-prone areas.
Mr Deuter said the 30-year-old company had documented the aftermath and devastation of bushfires.
The new service would allow the company to help with fire prevention, in line with recommendations from a number of inquiries following last summer’s horror bushfire season. “The new technology surpasses current and historic methodologies through delivering and visualising data not possible to be collected or seen from conventional satellite, aerial or drone-imagery firefighting tools,” Mr Deuter said.
“It provides real-time insights and ultra-high data capture density, at critical times, into fuel loads and their location underneath tree canopies.
“The breakthrough should allow emergency authorities, government and communities to adopt a far more science-based and pre-emptive fuel-load strike position ahead of this year’s bushfire season.” Fuel loads and hazard-reduction burns have been a key part of the conversation about bushfire prevention. In September, the State Government said it would dramatically increase hazard-reduction burns.
