WASHINGTON: The US has successfully launched a classified spy satellite into orbit via a new SpaceX Falcon rocket.
The launch of the two-stage Falcon 9 rocket was the second of three planned launches across a four-day period for the private space transportation outfit founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk. The aims of the National Reconnaisance Office’s satellite remain classified and SpaceX was forced to end a webcast of the rocket launch. It was the NRO’s first launch with Mr Musk’s company under a $US316m deal signed in 2020.
