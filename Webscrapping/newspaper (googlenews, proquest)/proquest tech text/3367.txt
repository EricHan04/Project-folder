ELECTRIC DREAMS: GLOOMY EYES Virtual Reality ***** Great Hall Masonic Lodge Until February 23 THINK of the classic works of Tim Burton, then take that into an immersive 360-degree digital environment, and you would only scrape the surface of how magical it is to experience Gloomy Eyes.
You can move your head to view each scene from any angle or even peer through tree branches and other bits of scenery to watch the action.
Every item shifts in perfect relation to its surrounds.
Narrated by actor Colin Farrell, the charming fantasy-horror tale – told in three chapters – is set in a world without sun, as a wicked uncle tries to stop the love between his niece and Gloomy, below, a zombie kid who introduces her to an underground wonderland.
While it only uses vision and sound, the experience is so convincing that it tricks and activates your other senses. So viewers may feel as if they are actually plummeting along with the characters or falling debris, and be compelled to physically move to avoid colliding with virtual objects.Gloomy Eyes is one of six VR films, which run for about 45 minutes each, as part of the Fringe’s Electric Dreams immersive storytelling program. You have only four days in which to experience the Electric Dreams films, so book fast.
