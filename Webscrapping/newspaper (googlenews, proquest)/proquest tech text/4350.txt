NEW regulations restricting the sale of nitrous oxide canisters – also known as nangs – over the counter and between certain times will come into effect in the new year.
A Bill to restrict the sale of nitrous oxide canisters to over-18s and require a register of buyers was voted down in State Parliament.
But the South Australian Controlled Substance Advisory Council met shortly afterwards and backed changes to regulations controlling the sale.The gas is typically used for sedation and pain relief but is also sold commercially as a quick way of whipping cream.
However, they are sold at most convenience stores in the city and are abused by people looking for a quick high or feeling of floating. The short-term effects are light-headedness, but long-term use has been linked to permanent brain and nerve damage.
The new regulations: RESTRICT the sale and supply of canisters to people aged over 18. PROHIBIT the public display of canisters in businesses.
BAN the sale of canisters between 10pm and 5am.
MANDATE display notices at point of sale showing the possible offences for sale and supply to minors.
The Opposition Bill was voted down 24 to 21 in the lower house yesterday morning. Assistant Opposition health spokesman Blair Boyer, pictured, who initially proposed the Private Members’ Bill, accused the Government of “rank hypocrisy” for voting down the measure while continuing their own plans to restrict the sale of nangs.Attorney-General Vickie Chapman said the new regulations recognised the legitimate uses for the gas but would “make it harder for those retailers who sell the canisters, most likely knowing they’ll be abused”.
