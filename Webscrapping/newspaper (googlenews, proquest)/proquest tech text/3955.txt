Victor Harbor Science Fair was a resounding success with 1600 visitors and organisers are in talks to make it an annual event stating it was a "huge day"!
The show's the finale of Nitro Nat's (Natalia Dworniczek) Crazy Colouful Chemistry Show at the Victor Harbor Science Fair on Sunday, June 27, shocked and surprised the big crowd, many were children.
The demonstration is called 'Elephant's toothpaste' and is an exothermic reaction (one that gives off heat) whereby a catalyst reagent is added to Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) to covert it to a steaming, watery (H2O) mixture that includes some detergent and food colouring.
"Always a winner at Science Collective science shows and the reaction of children in the crowd is priceless," the spokesperson said.
This show was one of four in each of the two sessions of the fair with dinosaur stories, circus tricks and live native animals and reptiles featured in the other shows.
Around 20 science outreach organisations provided interactive fun at the fair with Virtual Reality experiences, inflatable planetarium sessions, robotics, the slime bar, Daleks and the smoke cannon all very popular.
The event was made possible through the sponsorship of the City of Victor Harbor, Bendigo Community Bank and Inspiring SA.
The Rotary Club of Victor Harbor provided a BBQ for visitors and their volunteers were kept busy all day feeding the 1600 attendees.
"Visitors not only came from Victor and surrounds, but many families travelled from Adelaide and enjoyed not only the science fair, but local attractions and cafes. The Science Collective aims to make the fair an annual celebration of science in June and discussions have already commenced with the council and sponsors," the spokesperson said.
