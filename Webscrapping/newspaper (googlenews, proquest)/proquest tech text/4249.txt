A young child may have trouble explaining medical symptoms, yet a quick look at his facial expressions can reveal much about anxiety and pain.That's why Gaumard Scientific Company unveiled Pediatric HAL(r) S2225 (www.gaumard.com/S2225), the world's most advanced wireless and tetherless mobile pediatric patient simulator. HAL is designed to help health care students and professionals at all levels develop the specialised skills needed to effectively communicate with, diagnose, and treat young patients throughout the continuum of care. HAL's responsive features set a new standard for training across the pre-hospital, transport, emergency, nursing, and intensive care settings.Pediatric HAL is coming for a Down Under Tour for the first time from March 18 to 29, 2019 appearing at ten different events across Australia and New Zealand in conjunction with Gaumard's local distributor, Abacus dx (www.abacusdx.com).Be one of the first in the country to meet Pediatric HAL S2225. See HAL up close as he simulates lifelike emotions through dynamic facial expression, movement and speech.

Pediatric HAL introduces a host of new technologies including active robotics, which allows it to simulate nearly a dozen facial expressions, including anxiety, anger, amazement, ongoing and transient pain, and more. For the first time in pediatric simulation, HAL will offer clinical educators a solution for developing learners' communication skills and empathy through immersive patient-provider communication simulation experiences."We are thrilled to be able to showcase the latest technology in healthcare simulation in Australia and New Zealand with the Pediatric HAL Down Under Tour visiting 10 different sites across 11 days. Giving the industry access to innovative training products like the Pediatric HAL S2225 ensures that our healthcare providers are equipped to provide exceptionally high standards of care to patients; something that is important to all Australians and New Zealanders", said Abacus dx CEO, Shayne Christensen."Good communication skills are essential for diagnosing and treating children, yet until now, learners and clinicians haven't had a pediatric simulator that interacts with them in a realistic, lifelike way," John Eggert, executive vice president of Gaumard Scientific Company, says."With Pediatric HAL, you can practice handling difficult situations, such as how to communicate a serious medical diagnosis to a young child."Gaumard recognises that every second counts in pediatric emergency medicine and critical care. That is why Pediatric HAL is completely wireless and tetherless to ensure the continuum of care is never interrupted even as he is moved from outside the hospital to the emergency room and pediatric intensive care."Pediatric HAL raises the bar in anatomical and physiological fidelity, allowing participants to practice in-situ using real equipment and employ clinically accurate techniques. Participants can perform a full range of emergency procedures including surgical airway, needle decompression, and chest tube thoracostomy with the highest degree of realism. It's the closest experience to real world pediatric emergency care available today," said John Eggert.Pediatric HAL supports a broad range of real patient monitors and sensors and features dynamic lung compliance that responds to real mechanical ventilation. This enables learners to develop the skills needed to set up and operate equipment as they would in real clinical situations.Pediatric HAL includes 10 outcome-focused scenarios designed to replicate a variety of clinical situations throughout the spectrum of pediatric care. Accompanying each Simulation Learning Experience(tm) is a detailed written guide for setting up, planning, and facilitating the learning experience.
