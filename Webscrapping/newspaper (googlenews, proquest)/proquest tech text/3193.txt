ONE in six paramedics may be at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress disorder due to the strain of their role, Australian research has found.
With rates of PTSD four times higher for paramedics than the general population, Monash University is turning to virtual reality to better prepare the lifesavers to look after their own lives.
An analysis of PTSD studies has revealed those at greater risk of developing the disorder may be more likely to take up a career as a paramedic, which underlines the need for enhanced training, according to Monash’s Professor Brett Williams.
“It is the unpredictable and unscheduled nature of care that paramedics face each day that makes it a popular profession to join, but it also makes it one of the most demanding,” he said.Monash is using virtual reality to close the gap between training and real life, placing students in situations that can be difficult to prepare for.
