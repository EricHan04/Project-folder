The Illuminate Adelaide festival kicked off in Tumby Bay at the weekend, with many locals adventuring out to see some of the visual displays lighting up the night.
Augmented reality, neon installations and audio visual kept viewers entertained, along with the Colour Tumby Street Art Hub offering many activities from Saturday.
Guests from Illuminate Adelaide, Big Picture Series, and the South Australian Tourism Commission joined together with the local progress association, council, and Regional Development Australia Eyre Peninsula to officially open the event on Friday night.
Formalities began with a welcome to country performed by Barngarla Elder Emma Richards, followed by speeches from the guests and the mayor.
"It's a great time to be in Tumby Bay," said mayor Sam Telfer.
"It's a real testament to the hard work that's been done to get the visitation and get people off the highway into town to come and experience Tumby Bay."
SATC chair Andrew Bullock said that despite the challenges of COVID, many opportunities had opened up for regional towns like Tumby Bay.
"What you've done as a town is an absolute tribute to what can be done as a town to attract tourism," he said.
"When wandering the main street, the peace and tranquility here is something people travel all around the world to try and find."
Co-founder of Illuminate Adelaide Lee Cumberlidge also spoke about art being integrated with digital, and said they had found "fantastic" partners for the event through the local progress association.
"Illuminate is all about getting out in winter, embracing the cold," he said.
"Make sure the whole of the Eyre Peninsula comes out and sees it, and enjoy the next 10 days."
