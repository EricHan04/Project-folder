THE new quad bike mandatory safety code has come into effect, 12 months after the federal government announced it would enforce stricter measures.
As of Sunday, October 11, new and imported secondhand quad bikes sold in Australia must meet a number of safety requirements, such as being tested for lateral static stability, displaying the angle at which the quad bike tips onto two wheels on a hang tag at the point of sale, and carrying a roll-over warning label on the bike.
Other provisions include fitting a spark arrester conforming to the Australian or United States standard and other requirements on brakes, handlebars, foot wells and maximum speed capabilities.
There remains another 12 months before the installation of roll-over bars becomes mandatory on new quad bikes.
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission said the safety requirements were a good thing for those using the vehicles.
"This first stage of the standard is a significant step in improving the safety of quad bikes in Australia, and addressing the extremely concerning rate of injuries and fatalities caused by quad bike accidents," ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said.
"Consumers will now be able to have confidence that quad bikes they buy will meet a certain level of quality and safety."
