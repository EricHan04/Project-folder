THE state’s food and wine will come to life like never before at the new Immerse event in Light Square.
In a South Australian first, diners can enjoy an “augmented reality food experience” designed to enhance tastings from local producers such as Woodside Cheese and Gazander Oysters.
By using phones to track QR codes on selected tasting boards, guests can generate stunning visual animations over each food item.
There are also personal audio notes from Brendan Wessels, head chef at Light’s Aurora restaurant, to help guide diners through their meal.
People can select virtual buttons as they eat, to find out more about flavours and food combinations.
The experience is just one part of Immerse, a new annual festival at the Light hospitality and performance hub in Light Square in the city. The month-long program also includes Immersion, a 360-degree interactive show which puts viewers at the centre of an animated journey featuring changing landscapes dating back 50 million years.
Narrated by actor Erik Thomson, Immersion is screened in a new purpose-built venue, the Ellipse, inside the Light hub, and was created with help from Oscar-nominated SA visual effects artists. immerseadl.com.au
