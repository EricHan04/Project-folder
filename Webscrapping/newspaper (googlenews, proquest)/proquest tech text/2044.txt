MAYORAL CANDIDATES Linley Shine Port Augusta has always been home and I am proud that our city is attracting outstanding economic growth and opportunity across varied industry and business. Now, more than ever, it is vital that we harness and leverage from this on every occasion which requires strong, committed, and proven vision that is underpinned by principles and integrity. My long professional career has involved working across both the government and not-for-profit sectors in the areas of corporate governance, social policy, and sound engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders across regional and remote South Australia. I have extensive experience in leadership and representation, and importantly, I walk the talk and strive for excellence and accountability. I will bring a stronger, consultative, community voice to the role of Mayor, as that is what my leadership will focus on because Together we can SHINE - I am in this for us, nothing more, nothing less.

Rob Williams If elected, I will support best practices to ensure council makes sound decisions that reflect what the community needs. I will act with the utmost respect and integrity and I am committed not only for the people, but also the environment. I am concerned about the level of anti-social street behaviour by some people and the lack of respect and security of senior citizens of the community. I am concerned about the drug problem especially "ice" and other such drugs being trafficked into and around Port Augusta. I am not a member of any political party. I possess Diplomas in several subjects which help me with my professional aspirations of photographer and journalist. This is an unusual time for this city in these times of juvenile crime, disrespect for others and virtual hatred between the races. I want to bring both parties together for the common good of both parties and the city. I love music and learning to play my guitar.
