The Commonwealth has agreed to give Western Australia's space industry a $6 million funding boost to help it play a key role in the Australian Space Agency.
The federal government has agreed to invest $6 million in Western Australia's space industry so the state can play a significant role in the broader national expansion plan.
Most of the funds will be put towards a robotics and artificial intelligence mission control facility, while the remainder will be spent supporting space data analysis facilities.
The data benefits earth-based areas such as mining, agriculture, emergency services and maritime surveillance, while the mission control facility will work on remotely operating autonomous and robotic systems in space.
The WA government has so far allocated $2 million for its joint work with the Adelaide-based Australian Space Agency and will consider further funding in future budgets.
The ASA was established last year and seeks to triple the size of the nation's space sector, with a total investment commitment to date of $73.2 million.
