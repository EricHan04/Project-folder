Whyalla's dream of becoming a hydrogen hub has come one step closer to reality.
The state government is officially seeking Expressions of Interest (EOI) to develop land near Point Bonython, with a focus on hydrogen.
The Marshall Government has labelled the site 'one of SA's most prospective hydrogen export hubs', with access to relevant infrastructure making it a top choice.
Treasurer Rob Lucas said the state-owned site has outstanding access to multiple renewable energy zones and boasts over 2,000 hectares of available land.
Port Bonython also boasts access to an existing deep-water port, including the 2.4km-long jetty which has been approved for a $37 million state government-funded upgrade.
Mr Lucas said EOIs will be rated on their ability to develop projects that have the potential to create economic growth and regional development on the Eyre Peninsula.
"This is a significant piece of land that, when properly developed, has the potential to create significant economic and jobs growth not only for the Upper Spencer Gulf, but for the whole of South Australia," he said.
"Having a hydrogen hub exporting to Australian and international markets will leverage the $20 billion pipeline of large-scale renewable energy projects under development in South Australia.
"Our state is a great place in which to do business and we are committed to becoming a national and international exporter of clean power while obtaining our goals of 100 per cent renewables and 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030."
Whyalla Mayor Clare McLaughlin said investing in clean hydrogen was critical to the city's future; and aligns with "the green vision of both the city and our main employer GFG Alliance".
"We therefore welcome the State Government's focus on developing this area of importance, as well as for recognising that our city is well positioned to support our state and nation's push towards net zero emissions," she said.
