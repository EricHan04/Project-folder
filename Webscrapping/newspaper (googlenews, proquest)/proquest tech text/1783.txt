THE paddock-to-plate marketing concept has always proved popular, but agtech start-up Provenir uses the phrase more literally.
Aiming to eliminate the live transport of cattle, Provenir is effectively an abattoir on wheels, allowing for en route butchering, sales and distribution.
Looking to turn a concept into reality, last month the company kicked off a crowdfunding campaign, reaching its initial target of $33,000 within two weeks.
More than 100 supporters pledged to buy the first wave of Provenir's on-farm processed meat packs, which are expected to be delivered by the end of July 2019.
Provenir co-founder and chief marketing officer Jayne Newgreen said the use of crowdfunding was part of the company's business plan, not a marketing gimmick.
"Securing pre-purchase of our meat packs ensures the business viability in the crucial first few months," she said.
"While our supporters have been vocal and numerous during development stages of our business, it is vital that we translate this support into customers upon the launch of Provenir."
Provenir co-founder and chief executive officer Chris Balazs said Provenir's high welfare meat supporters would receive products that had full traceability and true provenance.
He says Provenir believes eliminating the stress associated with live transport to a large fixed abattoir will improve meat quality.
