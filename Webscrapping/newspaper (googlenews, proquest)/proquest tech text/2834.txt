MILLIONS of Australians will pocket extra cash through fast-tracked tax cuts to be included in today’s federal budget, designed to catapult the country out of recession.
Australia’s debt ceiling is expected to be lifted above $1.1 trillion as the Federal Government splashes more than $314bn on COVID-19 relief and recovery measures. South Australia’s GST slice will take a hit following a national dip of more than $7bn in revenue from the tax.

Millions of Australians will pocket $1080 or more in permanent tax cuts, which were originally scheduled for 2022, but are expected to be backdated to July 1 this year.
The “Stage 2” tax cuts will lift the top threshold for the 19 per cent bracket from $37,000 to $45,000, and top threshold for the 32.5 per cent tax bracket from $90,000 to $120,000.
“Stage 3” tax cuts scheduled for 2024, which slash the middle tax bracket to 30 per cent and abolish the 37 per cent tax bracket, are also likely to be brought forward.
It will cost the government billions of dollars on top of a $158bn personal income tax package.
The budget is also expected to have extra money for older Australians, after the aged-care pension increase was frozen when inflation went backwards.
There may also be more tax relief for low-income workers.
A deficit of more than $210bn will be revealed, and the budget is not expected to be back in the black within the next four years.
The debt ceiling is set to be lifted above $1.1 trillion to cover the deficits and the country faces being in debt for up to 30 years.
The 6.8 per cent unemployment rate is predicted to rise higher before December – but not as high as 10 per cent.
The budget will also show when Australia is likely to be out of its first recession in almost 30 years.
AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said fast-tracked tax cuts would be a cash injection for the economy, given people were likely to spend some of the money and save some.
“The important one to bring forward is Stage 2, because that yields a greater proportion of benefits to lower and middle-income earners and, therefore, a greater proportion of it will be spent,” Dr Oliver said.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann yesterday said it would be a “pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-recovery budget”.
He was coy on whether tax cuts would be backdated to July 1, but said: “We have a track record of always looking for opportunities to lower the tax burden on hardworking families.” The minister defended the mega-spend and debt-ceiling hike, saying the pandemic was a “massive hit on our economy”.
“There was no alternative but for the government to step up,” he said. Labor’s treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said Labor was open to backing Stage 2 tax cuts, but not Stage 3.
“Stage 3 is the least responsible, least affordable, least fair, and least likely to be effective because higher-income earners aren’t as likely to spend in the economy as workers of more modest means,” he said.
Dr Chalmers said the test for the government would be the jobless rate. PAGE 19: VALDMAN’S VIEW
