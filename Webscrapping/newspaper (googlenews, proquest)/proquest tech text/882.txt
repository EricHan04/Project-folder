The Eva copper project, planned by Canada’s Copper Mountain Mining, is named with two other Australian projects — Rex Minerals’ Hillside project in South Australia and KGL Resources’ Jervois mine in the Northern Territory — in a federal government report that forecasts the value, volume and price of Australia’s mining and energy exports.
The Resources and Energy Quarterly predicts the volume of Australia’s copper exports will rise by just over 7 per cent to 992,000 tonnes in the five years to 2025-26 but that its value will soar by 60 per cent to $16b.
It means copper will outstrip the value of our thermal coal exports, which are predicted to remain static around $15b.
The report says the worldwide energy transition to low emissions technologies is expected to positively impact copper consumption.
“Copper’s conductivity, malleability and durability make it vital to electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy generation,” the report says.
The $380 million Eva copper and gold project is expected to create 300 mining jobs and produce 45,000 tonnes of copper and 13,650 ounces of gold annually for 15 years.
The company has backed plans to connect the Mount Isa region to the National Electricity Market through development of the CopperString transmission line. Its feasibility study quotes electricity prices around half the cost under a CopperString term sheet of just under 10c/kWh compared with existing prices at Mount Isa.
CuString managing director Joseph O’Brien said the surging global demand for Queensland’s critical minerals backs the need to deliver the CopperString transmission line.
CuString Pty Ltd is the proponent of the 1100 km CopperString 2.0 high voltage transmission network that will link the North West Minerals Province to the national electricity grid. It wants to start the two-year construction of the $1.7b project later this year.
