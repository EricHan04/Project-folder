AUSTRALIA Post is encouraging young Aussies to learn more about science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics with the launch of this year’s Stamp Collecting Month and its theme, full STEAM ahead.
With children now back in the classroom, this year’s theme celebrates the way STEAM can be applied in the real world, with five stamps depicting virtual reality, hydroponics, space study, robotics and urban design.
Australia Post spokesman David McNamara said it was important to encourage skills to solve 21st century challenges.
“Most people are aware of STEM subjects, but by including arts as well, we are looking to acknowledge and encourage creativity, critical thinking and problem solving,” Mr McNamara said. “We want to inspire children to take a multi-disciplined approach to learning.” Stamps will be available from Tuesday in participating post offices and online. auspostcollectables.com.au
