The State Planning Commission is consulting the public on the company’s bid to build a solar farm on agricultural land it has bought at Stuart, 6km northeast of Morgan.
Origin has lodged plans for 150MW development, to form the first part of a potential two-stage project. If approved, the second stage, to connect through the proposed SA-NSW interconnector, would double the development’s capacity.
About 200-300 people would be needed over more than two years to help build the solar farm in its first stage, with another 5-10 people employed while it is operational.
Mid Murray Mayor Dave Burgess hoped the project would bring an economic boost to the region.
“We look forward to helping provide accommodation and local tradies and labour … (and) working with the developer if it’s approved,” he said.
“These sorts of things will bring new skills into our district and that’s always helpful. We’ve had growth within the region with different irrigation projects happening, and we’re always looking for other opportunities.”
Planning documents show the project is part of Origin’s bid to move towards clean energy.
“Origin has supported, through contracts and developments, over 1300MW of solar and wind farms across the National Electricity Market and, when developed, Morgan will be an important contributor to achieving this strategic objective,” the company said.
An Origin spokesman said the project’s time frame depended on market conditions, government policies and the status of the SA-NSW transmission interconnector.
He said Origin was working with ElectraNet to connect to the transmission network.
The company is yet to release cost and construction workforce estimates for the project’s second stage.
