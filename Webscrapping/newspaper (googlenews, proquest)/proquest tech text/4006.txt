Nine St Anne's Primary School students across two teams will represent Australia in the VEX Robotics World Championship.
The young tech gurus, with a group from Wodonga Middle Years College, qualified for the competition during nationals at the weekend.
Teacher Belinda Moran was with three of the school's teams in Adelaide.
"Between the three teams we took home seven awards," she said.
"To have two teams qualify for Worlds is a major achievement."
They will head to Kentucky in April, some for the second time - a team also competed in Worlds earlier this year.
"We didn't have a win, but we learned a lot," Ms Moran said.
"There were five divisions with 85 teams in each division.
"If you can beat China, you're doing pretty well."
St Anne's only began competing in 2017, but has quickly gone to top of the pops.
The North East is considered strong for VEX Robotics and Galen College hosted nationals in 2017.
