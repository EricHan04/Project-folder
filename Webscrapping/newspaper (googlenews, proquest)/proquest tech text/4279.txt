The store at 6/10 Harrow Rd will close permanently on Wednesday, November 25, and reopen nearby at the shopping mall at the corner of Harrow Rd and Queen St from November 26.
New features include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays, extended energy efficient chillers, improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
An Aldi spokesman said many of the improvements being implemented followed trials and Aldi’s statewide trials rollout in South Australia and Western Australia with better product displays, improved navigation and modern styling.
“While we’re delighted to be introducing these innovations at our new store, we want our customers to know they won’t lead to higher prices,” he said.
“Low prices are a big deal for Aldi. This is our fundamental point of difference and one we will never give away.”
ALDI Auburn Central will continue to be staffed by up to 25 permanent full and part-time employees.
The supermarket’s hours will continue to be 8.30am to 8pm Monday to Sunday, with extended hours until 9pm on Thursday.
