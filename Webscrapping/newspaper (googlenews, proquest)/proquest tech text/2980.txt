TIMMS Real Estate has unveiled its new “Google-style mega-office” in Lonsdale. The real estate agency’s new warehouse conversion headquarters on Sherriffs Rd comprises of 728sq m of industrial-style space featuring a gym, cafe, virtual reality room, games room, function centre and a coffee machine displaying slide shows to celebrate anniversaries and birthdays.
Timms Real Estate director and co-founder Valerie Timms said the changing nature of work, brought on by the pandemic, had inspired the design of the new space, which was already delivering a culture change for the organisation.
“During the work from home pandemic phase I think we realised we need each other and feed off each other’s ­energy,” she said.
“So what better place to do that than in a beautiful space that everyone enjoys. “While there are so many features that unite to create a vibrant culture, the heart of this building is the kitchen, which opens on to the sales desks and becomes like a modern boardroom and collaborative working hub.” Ms Timms said the design also featured a number of environmentally friendly features, which supported the firm’s ­vision to become Australia’s first carbon neutral real estate agency. “This is a tribute to Adelaide ingenuity with 12 Adelaide building firms coming together and more than 50 tradies and apprentices on site at some time during the six-month project build,” Ms Timms said.
