RESCUING a co-worker dangling from a power pole needs a calm and practised approach for success.
To get it right, Telstra has created a virtual reality technology package to train its workers.
“This offers a setting that makes the participant feel like they are exposed to hazardous real-world settings and the incident is happening right in front of them, yet they are actually in the safety of a Telstra building,” Telstra field manager David Aistrope said.
Trainees are equipped with a VR headset and two hand controllers then given specific tasks, including power pole rescue, working on electric panels and first aid. Field worker Dan Goad said being able to train for different scenarios in one place would save a lot of travel time “And it’s a lot more interesting and realistic than just being taught in a classroom,” he said. Telstra is investing about $1m in the VR kits.
