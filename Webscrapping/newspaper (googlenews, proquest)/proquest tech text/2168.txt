THE state government will axe two programs that encourage the uptake of renewable energy in today’s state budget, saving $19m.
Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis confirmed in parliament the Home Battery Scheme and Switch for Solar program would end.
He said the home battery subsidy was “another very ambitious program by the previous government”.
“They wanted to have 40,000 batteries rolled out over four years,” he said on Wednesday.
“They had a cunning plan. What they were going to do is continually decrease the subsidy and somehow, inversely, it would increase the uptake of home batteries.” Mr Koutsantonis said the Switch for Solar program looked to strip pensioners of their concessions in exchange for solar panels and batteries. But Opposition Leader David Speirs said the programs “have a practical impact on lowering emissions in South Australia”. “The government is more interested in empty gesture and symbolic rhetoric, rather than getting on with the job by transitioning SA households to renewables,” he said.
