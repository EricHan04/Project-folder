THOMAS Foods International’s new $300m abattoir at Murray Bridge has passed a key milestone with construction of the 10-storey automated packaging building well under way.
The South Australian meat producer is building a new facility 10km outside Murray Bridge to replace its former abattoir, also in Murray Bridge, which was destroyed by fire in early 2018.
Thomas Foods said on Friday that above-ground works had started at the new site, with the packaging building, which will be the facility’s centrepiece, under construction.
“As the highest structure to be located on-site, the packaging building will have capacity to store 40,000 cartons of frozen and chilled meat products within the storage and retrieval system, and will feature the latest in automation and robotics technology,” the company said. Stage one, which is expected to be finished late next year, will include beef processing and animal handling facilities; a beef boning room with automated packaging technology; stockyards; a wastewater treatment plant; and■electrical, refrigeration and boiler systems.
