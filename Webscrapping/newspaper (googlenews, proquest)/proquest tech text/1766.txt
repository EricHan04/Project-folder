Federal election: May 18 looms as a very important election for all Australians.
As a member of the National Farmers' Federation, Primary Producers SA has been involved in policy for the election.
We have attended meetings with the Agriculture Minister David Littleproud and have met with opposition agriculture spokesperson Joel Fitzgibbon. A Press Club debate was also held on May 8 between the two alternatives to be Minister after the election.
ACCC role: The SA Dairyfarmers' Association is pleased the recent federal budget contained an announcement that there would be ongoing funding for the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission's Agriculture Unit. It is hoped this unit will take a more active role in overseeing the dairy industry.
The Agriculture Unit was established to examine competition and unfair trading issues in agricultural supply chains with a view to improving enforcement and compliance with the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 across agriculture.
Dog Fence: The recently-announced $20-million commitment by the federal and South Australian governments to the $25m replacement of 1600 kilometres of the SA Dog Fence has been welcomed by Livestock SA. We are also seeking bipartisan support to ensure that, whatever the election result, this support will be locked in.
AgTech Group: Nominations are sought for a new Ministerial AgTech Advisory Group, as part of the state government's concerted focus to grow primary industries. AgTech has been identified as a key growth area to help farmers boost agriculture to a $100-billion industry by 2030.
Some of the key areas to be looked at by the group include overcoming barriers that may be preventing local producers from adopting new or emerging technologies, commercialisation and focusing on a long-term strategy to grow AgTech. Anyone with interest and experience from across primary industry sectors, notably in grains, horticulture, meat and livestock, should apply.
