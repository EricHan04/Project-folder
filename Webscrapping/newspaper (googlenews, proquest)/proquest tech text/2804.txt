The 18-year-old student from Bordertown, South Australia, is completing a Bachelor of Agriculture at Charles Sturt University, while taking part in Western Ag’s agronomist stream in their accelerated undergraduate program.
The program will see James working at the Bordertown branch alongside agronomists, while completing his degree over six years.
While the program extends his studies an extra two years, James said the first-hand experience was invaluable.
“Learning at the same time by being in the workforce will (help me) progress to being an agronomist or doing the agronomy job quicker,” James said.
“Even after finishing the degree at university, it still takes four years of learning to be able to understand it so I will be getting the best of both worlds at the moment, which is ideal.”
James has been at the branch for about three weeks, but has already learned the ins and outs of being an agronomist.
“I have learned heaps already, I’m in the shed at the moment and dealing with chemicals,” he said.
“I have already done a few paddock checks with a couple of the agronomists.”
And the best part about the program for James is being able to build a life in his community, instead of travelling away to study.
“I won’t go away to Adelaide and get stuck in Adelaide like a lot of people do,” James said. “I get to stay in Bordertown, play footy for the local club and everything like that. Instead of moving away and never coming back is the thing that is ideal about it,” he said.
Western Ag director Philip Hawker said communities such as Bordertown and Kaniva were having difficulties finding agronomists.
“Through this program students will be able to stay, build relationships and start a career,” Mr Hawker said. “Students get full-time work and extra leave to complete their degree and their study costs are also supported by us.”
