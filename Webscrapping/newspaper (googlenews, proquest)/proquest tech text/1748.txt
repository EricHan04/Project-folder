SA’s agricultural waste could be used to create new post-farmgate industries worth more than $100 million a year.
This is the aim of a new $11 million research consortium led by the University of Adelaide.
Some of these high-value products could include sunscreen from mushroom waste, skincare products from apples and berries and hi-tech materials from brussels sprout stalks. Research consortium director Professor Vincent Bulone said up to 40 per cent of SA’s primary production could end up as waste, sometimes left to rot in the field or turned into low-value products such as compost or animal feed.
“But all of this food waste contains compounds that have high-value potential applications,” Prof Bulone said.
“Some can act as prebiotics or antioxidants, some have anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial properties, others, in particular carbohydrates, provide mechanical strength and texturising properties in food, lubricants, cosmetics and structural materials.
“Our research will cover the entire value chain from our local growers to manufacturers of food products and beverages, skincare products, and green materials.” State Innovation and Skills Minister David Pisoni launched the research consortium – supported with a $4 million grant through the Research Consortia Program – at the university’s Waite campus late last month.“Science and research are of enormous value to our economy, our society and critical to SA’s prosperity,” Mr Pisoni said. “Industries like agtech are driving economic growth and creating new, knowledge-intensive jobs.”
