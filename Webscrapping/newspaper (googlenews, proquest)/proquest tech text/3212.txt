THE Tour Down Under will feature heavily in the work of the first student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to take on a pilot internship at Lot Fourteen’s Living Laboratory.
Casey Bussone, a mathematician and computer scientist, is building programs to analyse data on tourists in South Australia, with high levels of detail.
The data will accurately track location and spending behaviour of tourists during the tour, as well as the Fringe and Festival.
“I will create visualisations from the data such as heat maps to provide information on where tourists are staying and spending their money while in Adelaide,” Mr Bussone said.
“This will help make decisions on how to better accommodate tourists and be more aware of where tourists are spending their money.” The Living Laboratory is a joint venture between MIT, principal sponsor Bank SA, Optus Business, DSpark, the State Government and universities.Real data sets from Optus and Bank SA are used to track thousands of tourists with greater accuracy than traditional methods such as surveys. “It’s aggregated so it respects people’s privacy but it will tell us the numbers of people travelling to certain areas when they’re here to, for example, the zoo or casino or Glenelg,” Mr Bussone said.
“Knowing that can help plan activities so more tourists experience the entirety of the city, not just the Tour or the Fringe.” The project will later include creating a virtual reality Adelaide, which people can visit and check out tourist drawcards.Mr Bussone is in Adelaide for a month ahead of the exchange program expanding so groups of MIT students will visit Adelaide annually and UniSA and University of Adelaide students will go to the prestigious MIT campus in Boston. He has been impressed by the growing tech community at Lot Fourteen as well as the warm welcome he has received.
