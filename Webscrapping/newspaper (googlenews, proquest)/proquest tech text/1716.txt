TWO AgTech demonstration farms will be established in the South East, heralding a new future for state government-owned research centres.
At the Struan Research Centre on Friday, Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister Tim Whetstone announced a partnership between the state government and Elders.
They wish to trial emerging agricultural technologies, with a focus on the livestock sector, at the Struan and Kybybolite research farms.
Mr Whetstone was particularly excited about demonstration site Digital Farm, which will allow farmers to experience AgTech solutions in a real-world context, from monitoring stock to on-farm connectivity.
Once the sites are developed, farmers will be able to experience the latest animal genetics and pasture varieties, as well as modern water utilisation, disease management and grazing strategies.
The partnership will form part of the Thomas Elder Institute - Elders' newly-established research, development and extension facility.
