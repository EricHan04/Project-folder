FARMING has come a long way from open cabs and narrow machinery to tractors equipped with autosteer and so many sensors, but the next generation of farmers will see many more changes.
Last week more than 100 secondary students from seven schools across the South East got a glimpse of the emerging AgTech and latest innovations at the Crop Science Investigators field day held at the Naracoorte High School.
The sessions which the students rotated through included plant breeding for a growing population, soil health and its importance to the cropping system, plant growth and biosecurity and innovative machinery design, including CASEIH's AFS Connect which can enable technicians to fix machinery remotely.
From the information gained the students will now use STEM principles and come up with innovative equipment or a tool that could be used within the grains industry.

Naracoorte High School agriculture teacher Emma Phillips said the day, which followed a similar event on Eyre Peninsula last year, had been a great success and hoped it would become an annual field day.
She thanked Ag Communicators and Hage Tractors and Implements who had been big instigators of the event.
Ms Phillips said it was important students made the connection between technology and agriculture and understood the many career opportunities available within the sector.
"Anything we can get the students involved in which shows them technology in ag is the way of the future is a good thing," she said.
"You can still work on a farm but you can also have that technical knowledge to be able to improve yields and quality of those crops and grains on your property."
