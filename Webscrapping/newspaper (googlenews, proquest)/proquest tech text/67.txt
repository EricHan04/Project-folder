IT’S a long way from Loxton to the Jezero Crater landing site on Mars. But Loxton High graduate Sam Nitschke has it roughly mapped out. His route might go via Whaler’s Way at the tip of Eyre Peninsula, to the SpaceX Boca Chica launch site in Texas and on to the red planet.
For his SACE research project, Sam studied the optimal propulsion system for a crewed Mars mission.
“Elon Musk was an inspiration but there were a lot of people in Adelaide I could talk to,” he said of the project, for which he received one of his two SACE Merits.
Sam, 17, aims to study aerospace engineering at Adelaide University. “I’ve been in love with space for as long as I can remember, so it was my natural choice,” he said.
Then he hopes to get a foot in the burgeoning sector’s door through an SA company such as Southern Launch, which fired a rocket from Koonibba near Ceduna in September and is progressing its Whaler’s Way site.
That could create a pathway to one of the big space companies or agencies such as Lockheed-Martin or NASA, he said. He dreams of one day playing a role in a manned mission to Mars.
As a youth leader, Sam managed to get regular coverage of his school in the local Loxton News.
He was pivotal in establishing a Rotary Interact Club, a service club run by young people, and he was a founding member of the Loxton Community Cluster.
“The cluster looks at Loxton as a small community and how we can capitalise on our current assets and improve and adapt to what we face in the 21st century,” he said.
“We’re an agricultural town with an ageing population. So what do we need to invest in to keep people coming to Loxton and what industries can we grow for the next 50 years?” He enjoyed the “sense of camaraderie” with his Year 12 teachers.
