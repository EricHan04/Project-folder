A HIGH school water polo team left nothing in the tank as they swam a staggering 130km to raise funds for virtual reality goggles for children in palliative care.
The team from St Peters College swam the equivalent of three return lengths of the English Channel to raise almost $12,000 for the HAS foundation in March. The foundation purchased and donated two pairs of Smiley Scope medically specialised goggles to the palliative care unit at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
Designed to reduce pain and anxiety for children during procedures, the headsets allows the sick kids to escape their pain and “travel” into amazing virtual worlds.
Captain of the water polo team Ned Gauvin said the team spent more than three hours in the pool.
“It was rewarding, when you know its for such a good cause,” he said. Founder of the HAS Foundation Ella Stratton, whose son Hunter Alfred Stratton passed away three years ago, said it became a bit of a competition between each swimmer as to who could raise the most money.
