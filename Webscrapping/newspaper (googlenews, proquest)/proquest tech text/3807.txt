A GROUP of high school students have given up their holidays in the hope their space careers will one day take off.
The 14 students, selected from 260 applicants, have spent the past few days of their holidays with space industry professionals.
Shail Shah, 17, is one of three students who has been working at Flinders University’s Tonsley campus learning about space, robotics and control systems.
“It’s really exciting. I’ve always been fascinated by robots,” says Shail, who is about to go into Year 12 at Plympton International College.
Shail, who is aiming for a career in the space sector, believes there will be many positions created in the space industry South Australia in the future.
His work experience was under the guidance of the university’s Associate Professor Russell Brinkworth – a specialist in bringing the knowledge of biology, especially vision, into robotic applications. The program was run by the Education Department and SA Space Industry Centre.
Meanwhile, a team from Adelaide University is competing in a global competition, organised by NASA, to design robots for the moon.
The competition involves designing and coding lunar robots to locate, excavate, load and transport water ice and other substances. The Adelaide University team is one of 22 finalists from a global starting field of 114.
