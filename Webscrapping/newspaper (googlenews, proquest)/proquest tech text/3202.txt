The magic of auroras, stars and space travel was brought to life at TastroFest schools day.
Author and aeronautical engineer Dr Shanna Rudov-Clark said talking about astronomy was a great starting point for getting students engaged with science.
"It captures their imagination and give science a bit of a glamorous edge," she said.
Dr Rudov-Clark's first children's book There's Magic in the Sky explains the phenomenon of auroras using simple, rhyming language.
She's currently working on her second book, Eight Aussie Spidernauts, which is inspired by some experiments carried out by schools in South Australia where garden orb weaver spiders were sent into space.
"I'm really keen to bring something like that to Tassie."
Dr Rudov-Clark said she was pleased to move back to Hobart after working as an engineering lecturer in Melbourne.
She is studying a masters of teaching to teach maths and physics.
She will be talking to TastroFest visitors about auroras and how to get into a career as an engineer.
"It's such a good time and it's great to meet the kids up here," she said.
"They're exposed to so many different things."
TastroFest will be open to the public on Friday August 2, from 6pm to 9pm and Saturday August 3 from 10am to 9pm.
Visitors can dress up as their favourite Sci-Fi or 1960s character to be in the running to win prizes.
Entry costs $10 per adult, $5 concession and free for children 12 years and under.
