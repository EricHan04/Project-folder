THE prospect of a South Australian nuclear energy future is being thrust on to the agenda by an opinion poll showing majority support for law changes to allow the industry to be considered.
The poll of 600 SA voters also shows 63 per cent agree nuclear power should be considered because of cost and reliability issues in the national electricity market.
The JWS Research poll, commissioned by the SA Chamber of Mines and Energy (SACOME) found 58 per cent backed amending federal environment and radiation protection laws to remove nuclear industry prohibitions.
SACOME chief executive officer Rebecca Knol said: “Nuclear presents an untapped economic opportunity for SA, particularly coupling modern reactors with abundant gas and renewable energy to meet net zero commitments”.
But Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday bluntly dismissed Opposition Leader Peter Dutton’s move to review advanced and next-generation nuclear technologies, declaring: “The truth is renewables are the cheapest. We will deliver increased renewables.” The opinion polling found respondents who backed a conversation about nuclear energy were influenced by SA’s geologically stable location, nuclear energy’s low carbon footprint and its ability to generate large volumes of electricity with little land use.
A 2016 SA nuclear royal commission, spearheaded by former governor Kevin Scarce, found nuclear power was not commercially viable but might be necessary in the future.
Premier Peter Malinauskas said he was “open-minded” but cited the royal commission’s finding it was unviable economically and likely would drive up electricity prices. He said his focus was on generating jobs, investment and lower power prices with Labor’s $593m hydrogen power plant slated for Whyalla. “Hydrogen is the energy source of the future and SA has all the ingredients to be a world-leader,” he said.
