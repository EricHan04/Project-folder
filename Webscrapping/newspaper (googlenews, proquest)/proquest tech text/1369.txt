ROCKETS could soon be lighting up the skies around Port Lincoln thanks to a new South Australian start-up initiative.
Southern Launch has taken up a lease of 1200ha of the freehold land at Whaler’s Way, 38km south of Port Lincoln, where it plans to develop a rocket launching facility capable of deploying tiny satellites into polar orbit.
A sea change in the past few years in how satellites operate in terms of size, orbit, distance from Earth, longevity and cost means big names like Amazon and Elon Musk’s SpaceX are putting serious money into creating webs of thousands of satellites orbiting in harmony.
“Manufacturers are saying we’ll put up a satellite now knowing that, in two years’ time, the technology will be obsolete and then we’ll put up another satellite,” said Lloyd Damp, chief executive of Southern Launch.
The company is in discussions with organisations around the world on using Whaler’s Way. Initially, components will be shipped in but “over time they will look at setting up a local assembly operation”.Southern Launch aims to have its facility built by the end of 2020. “Now is the right time for this,” Damp said.
