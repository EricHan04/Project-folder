WHO better to launch a shiny new rocket than “woman on a mission” Flavia Tata Nardini.
When the Sunday Mail discovered South Australian wine institution Penfolds was releasing its limited-edition “Venture Beyond” luxury gift collection, we invited the trailblazing CEO of Adelaide’s Fleet Space Technologies to be the star of an exclusive photo shoot.
Ms Tata Nardini was on board, posing with the Bin 389 Cabernet Shiraz 2019 in a rocket-shaped tin at her satellite company’s Beverley headquarters.
With hair and make-up by Ali Knight, she wore a one-off futuristic design created by Adelaide fashion house couture+love+madness’ Cristina Tridente.
Centred around space exploration, the “Venture Beyond” theme is designed to propel Penfolds from “fine wine brand” to “global luxury icon”.
Ms Tata Nardini said the marketing strategy was on-trend.
“I love that every other single industry around space is trying to find a connection,” she said.
Noting the women astronauts featured on the chardonnay and shiraz cabernet boxes, Ms Tata Nardini said, “this is good”. She has much to celebrate with SA set to become the country’s biggest satellite manufacturer.
