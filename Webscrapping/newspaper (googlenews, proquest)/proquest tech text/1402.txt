NASA has declared its Mars rover Opportunity dead after 15 years on the Red Planet.
Opportunity fell silent eight months ago during a dust storm and despite more than 1000 attempts to communicate with it, there has been no response. “I was there yesterday and I was there with the team as these commands went out into the deep sky, and I learned this morning that we had not heard back,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s science mission directorate, said. “Opportunity remains silent.
“I declare the Opportunity mission as complete.”.
Opportunity landed on Mars on January 25, 2004. It was only meant to be deployed for a 90-day mission but proved particularly robust.
During its years of intrepid exploration across Mars, it advanced human knowledge by confirming that water once flowed on the Red Planet.
Opportunity sent back 217,594 images from Mars, all of which were made available on the internet.
“For the public, the big change was that Mars became a dynamic place, and it was a place that you could explore every day,” Emily Lakdawalla, an expert on space exploration and senior editor at The Planetary Society.Today, only a single rover is still active on Mars, Curiosity, which arrived in 2012. In 2021, the recently named Rosalind Franklin robot, part of the European-Russian ExoMars mission, is slated to land on a different part of the planet.
