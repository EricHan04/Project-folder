WHILE much of the Drought Communities Programme funding doled out to councils impacted by drought has been directed toward infrastructure spending, District Council of Karoonda and East Murray has included a farmer and community wellbeing component under round two, announced earlier this year.
The council has developed the Drought Support and Resilience Program to be delivered to the region's farmers through to March 2021.
The program will cover key focus areas including mental and physical health, business management, sustainable land and diversification.
Kicking off the program last week at Perponda was the first in a series of Farmers Breakfasts, giving the district's farmers a chance to hear from industry speakers on relevant topics like genetically-modified crops, but also offering a setting to catch up with fellow farmers.
DCKEM, with the help of Rural Business Support, will deliver a Farm and Small Business Finances Event at the Karoonda Hotel tomorrow (Friday) covering budgets, banking and accountancy and the difference between personal and business finances.
A Precision Ag Demo Day will be held for local farmers at Karoonda Oval on Friday next week, with presentations from a range of speakers on topics like robotics in agriculture, drones, electric tractors, data and telematics, deep ripping and nrmFARM.
DCKEM mayor Caroline Phillips said the past several seasons had brought mixed results for the region's farmers and the council was acutely aware of the impact low rainfall had on the entire community.
"If farmers, who make up the vast majority of our local businesses, aren't able to spend money, it impacts on our whole community," she said.
"With round two of the Drought Communities funding, as well as further infrastructure upgrades to community-owned buildings and reserves, we wanted to provide a program of events and activities that would make our farming sector more resilient in the future, as we know that dry times will come again."
