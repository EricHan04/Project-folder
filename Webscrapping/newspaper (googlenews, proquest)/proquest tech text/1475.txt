Yes ...................................................... 20pc No ....................................................... 80pc EDITORIAL WHEN people talk about agtech, it can be very easy to think of it as a modern phenomena. Naturally, it's about computers and GPS and data collection, right?
But once upon a time, agtech was the stump jump plough or the Ridley stripper, which allowed farmers to take the next step and save serious time.
As Elders' Andrew Phelan said last week at the 'Growing the Future' conference in Adelaide, the agriculture sector is very good at adapting.
We regularly showcase farmers who are trying something a little different. Sometimes it doesn't work, but at least they gain knowledge. Then sometimes it does work, and it becomes part of their management.
In this edition of Stock Journal, we have a cropper looking over the fence to his neighbour's by-product and finding a way to ease his input costs. We have sheep producers changing focus to meet market needs and gaining a premium. We have a puppy, which could grow up to change the way we manage animal diseases.
Farming is all about finding the next "edge" - either big or small. Reading these pages, I am constantly impressed at the innovative ideas people come up with. And, with the backing of industry bodies and government, this can only continue.
