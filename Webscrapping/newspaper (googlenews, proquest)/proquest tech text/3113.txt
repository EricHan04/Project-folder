The Adelaide Showground has been a hub of activity this week, with the SA Junior Heifer Expo having kicked off on Monday, and finishing up today (Thursday).
Expo coordinator Justine Fogden said it was "fantastic" to be back, after COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the 2020 event.
"There haven't been too many youth ag events happening recently, and two were cancelled in NSW last week, so it's great to have this up and running again," Ms Fogden said.
This year, entrants were capped at 150, with 146 entrants having participated. Five entrants from Qld and 1 NSW entrant were initially enrolled, but unable to attend due to COVID-19. Three sisters from WA, three Tasmanians and 13 Victorians have taken part in the event.
In a "normal" year, Ms Fogden said the event usually attracted about 180 entrants, including about 10 from NSW.
Despite recent COVID-19 scares in SA and across the border, she said the event was still able to run to a fairly similar schedule to previous years.
"Not a lot has had to be changed, but if we were on level 1 or 2 restrictions it would have been a lot more difficult," she said.
Twelve-year-old twins Maddison and Emily Hann, Lucindale, are competing in the Expo for the fourth time this year.
"The Heifer Expo is such a great experience, I've learnt so much and I love everything about it," Maddison said.
For 12-year-old Harry Cartledge, Meningie, who is taking part for a second time this year, the Heifer Expo is an opportunity to improve his skills in the show ring. Harry's twin sister Elizabeth is excited to be participating for a third time.
This year's program has included virtual reality sessions, interviewing and public speaking presentations, a red meat session run by Thomas Foods International, a presentation from AuctionsPlus, a careers session, as well as marketing and show preparation sessions.
