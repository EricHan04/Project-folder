ADELAIDE actress Tilda Cobham-Hervey will co-star with Australian acting legend Hugo Weaving in a thriller set in contemporary Melbourne, Lone Wolf.
According to reports out of Hollywood, Tilda, right, who is based in the US with superstar boyfriend Dev Patel, will play a young woman, Winnie, who runs a bookstore while caring for her disabled brother.
Written and directed by Jonathan Ogilvie whose 2008 mystery The Tender Hook also starred Hugo, Lone Wolf is part funded by Screen Australia and the Melbourne International Film Festival, and attracted interest in the lead-up to the Cannes Film Festival with worldwide sales rights acquired by LevelK.
The film is based on Joseph Conrad’s 1907 novel The Secret Agent, about a group of anarchists planning a terrorist attack.
It is understood Hugo will play a police minister who is involved in the conspiracy.
It is expected to start shooting in Melbourne early next month with an expected 2020 release.
Tilda’s biopic about Australian singer Helen Reddy, I Am Woman, is due for release later this year although no date has been announced.
Another US film Burn, in which Tilda plays a gas attendant at a station held up by Billy (The Hunger Games’ Josh Hutcherson) is also in post production.
Tilda and Dev, who met in Adelaide on the set of their film Hotel Mumbai, will also team up to make a 12-minute online film and virtual reality project.
Funded by Screen Australia, the project is about about “an adorable thimble-sized hamster” who becomes murderous.
The star couple also worked together last year on the short film Home Shopper, starring their Hotel Mumbai co-star Armie Hammer.“I still feel so at the beginning of it all and I still have so much to learn but it is such an exciting time to be working,” Tilda says.
