If Meg Ryan was waiting for Tom Hanks at the top of the Empire State Building today, she wouldn’t be on the 86th floor.
The iconic 86th Floor Observatory in New York, further immortalised in the scene from Sleepless in Seattle, has been superseded by a new Observatory Experience 16 storeys higher on the Empire State Building’s 102nd floor.
Located 381m in the air, the 102nd Floor puts visitors in the centre of Manhattan, offering 360-degree views through floor-to-ceiling glass. Access is via a glass lift between the 86th and 102nd floors. Tickets to the 86th Floor start from $US38 (about $56) access to the new viewing area an extra $20. In other New York news, the Museum of Modern Art reopens this week after its four-month, $US450 million renovation.
