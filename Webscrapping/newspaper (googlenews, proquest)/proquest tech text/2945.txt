The local share market has fallen by nearly a percentage point, its biggest drop in six weeks.
After weeks of gains, the local share market has taken a breather, pulling back across the board as the bourse nears what one analyst calls a crucial week for the market. 
The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Monday down 67.6 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 7046.9, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 71.5 points, or 0.97 per cent, to 7287.2.
The ASX200 has been up for the past five weeks and four out of the past five sessions. Monday's losses, while hardly extraordinary, were its worst since July 11. 
"This week is really a pivotal moment for the Aussie share market," Saxo Capital Markets Australia market analyst Jessica Amir told AAP.
"We've risen for five straight weeks, but now this week is a couple of catalysts standing in our way.
"Locally, lots of earnings are on tap - Qantas, our biggest airline; Whitehaven Coal, this year's best performer and our biggest company; as well Coles, Woolies, Wesfarmers," Ms Amir said.
There were also around companies going ex-dividend in the coming days, Ms Amir said.
Finally, she says, in the United States, central bankers and economists will begin gathering on Thursday discussing the state of the economy at the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming.
"So top of the agenda will be talking about the question how high interest rates need to go to reign in inflation - so we're of thinking this will be the defining point for equities and could send equities lower," Ms Amir said, predicting hawkish commentary out of the Jackson Hole.
"So a lot hanging on this week."
