PREMIER Steven Marshall and Innovation and Skills Minister David Pisoni spent more than $18,000 on luxury chauffeured vehicles during a 10-day trip to the United States.
Freedom of Information documents obtained by the Opposition reveal taxpayers were billed about $12,000 to whisk Mr Marshall around in chauffeured vehicles and $6297 for limousines for Mr Pisoni during the January expedition. Included in the bill were seven separate chauffeured vehicle rides that cost more than $1000 each.
Mr Marshall and Mr Pisoni visited Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and Salt Lake City, meeting with several companies including Tesla, SpaceX, Warner Brothers, Disney and Netflix.
Opposition deputy leader Susan Close said the spending “just doesn’t pass the pub test”.
A Government spokeswoman said the Government was “happy to compare its travel expenses with the Labor Party’s every day of the week”.She said the US trip had helped secure the filming of the next Mortal Kombat movie in SA.
