THE cashless welfare card system used in Ceduna is in line for an overhaul, to better target the spending on gambling and alcohol that it aims to curb.
Under changes to the card system, “product-level blocking” will be introduced over the next two years, to automatically decline transactions that include restricted items.
It comes as the card system will be extended indefinitely in Ceduna, where it was introduced in 2016. Welfare recipients receive 80 per cent of their payments on a debit card.
Federal Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said the changes replaced the previous system of blocking entire merchants that sold restricted items or required them to block specific products. “Once product-level blocking is enabled, the point-of-sale system scans customer baskets for restricted items,” Senator Ruston said.
“If any restricted items are present then the PIN pad will decline the payment request.
“This means that cashless debit card participants will be able to shop at even more businesses.” Major merchants are developing and implementing their own product-level blocking solutions, including Coles, Woolworths and Aldi. “The government is also working with small to medium merchants to introduce this technology and has successfully implemented a trial at around 10 merchants,” Senator Ruston said.
