A SOUTH-EAST business is helping teach children about apple, chickpea, forestry and dairy production with the help of its fictional character George the Farmer.
Co-creators Simone Kain and Ben Hood set up George the Farmer in 2015 and have since used the brand to educate children about farming practices, through resources including picture books, apps, music and performances.
The brand launched new resources this week, coinciding with National Science Week, including virtual reality experiences, videos and teachers’ guides.
Ms Kain hopes they will support teachers who have experienced a tumultuous two years in the classroom, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
George the Farmer is a forester from Mt Gambier, who also has been sharing stories about food waste, vegetables, fruit and bees, while teaching children about where food and fibre comes from.
“We’re on a mission to connect kids across Australia with the earth, food and farm,” Ms Kain says. “Increasing children’s knowledge will also help to secure the beautiful clean, green food that we take for granted in Australia.”
