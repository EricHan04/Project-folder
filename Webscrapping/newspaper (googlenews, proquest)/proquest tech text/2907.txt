A YOUNG Tasmanian is set to be judged against the best young engineers in the country after he was recognised as Tasmania’s Young Professional Engineer of the Year.
David Ewers believed it was his work in the renewable energy sector he had been recognised for.
“The award is for anyone who’s shown contribution to the engineering field,” Mr Ewers said.
“I don’t think I’d realised how much I’d done within 10 years in the engineering sector.” He said his engineering work had taken him across the country. “I started in South Australia and worked on a rail extension project, I’ve worked on the Riverbank Bridge, also in South Australia.
“I’ve worked on a defence upgrade in civil design zones.
“I worked on the Cattle Hill Wind Farm in Tasmania as a senior project engineer.” Mr Ewers, who works for VEC Civil Engineering, said he hoped to inspire young Tasmanians to pursue engineering. “There’s nothing more important than passing on your knowledge to the next generation and seeing young Tasmanians take up engineering.” The Young Australian Engineer of the Year will be announced in November.
