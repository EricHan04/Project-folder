KICKING off Christmas in the city is just the start of Grace Johnston-Bolton’s festive season.
The seven-year-old switched on the lights of the giant Christmas tree in Victoria Square on Wednesday night, ahead of her eighth birthday on Christmas Day.
The year 2 student was randomly selected from 142 children who entered a council competition to score the gig of lighting up the largest Christmas tree of its kind in the southern hemisphere.
“The star is my favourite on the Christmas tree because it is super glowy,” Grace said.
“I love going to Victoria Square to look at the Christmas lights, Rundle Mall and Adelaide Zoo at Christmas time … every year we go to Adelaide Zoo.” The light-up is part of the city’s inaugural Christmas Festival, which cost ratepayers $400,000.
The festival includes an augmented reality trail around the city and North Adelaide that decks Adelaide landmarks with decorations and displays. There also will be musicians and bauble art installations on Peel St and Vaughan Place.
Lord Mayor Sandy Verschoor looked forward to celebrations in the city. “Christmas is the most magical time of year and we are excited to welcome people to Adelaide this Christmas to experience everything our beautiful city has to offer,” she said. The tree will light up at 8.30pm every night until Christmas Eve.
