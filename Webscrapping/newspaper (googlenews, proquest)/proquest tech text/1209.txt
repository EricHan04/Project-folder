A THREE-metre piece of space junk from Elon Musk’s spacecraft has crashed into a farmer’s property in NSW at around 25,000km/h.
The object – which was part of the SpaceX Crew-1 craft – was found in a sheep paddock by a farmer living on a large property in the Snowy Mountains.
Farmer Mick Miners said he discovered the space junk, which resembled a tree from a distance, after his family heard a loud bang.
The bang was also reportedly heard by residents living in southern NSW, with some alleging they saw an explosion.
Neighbouring farmer Jock Wallace also reported a similar foreign object that had torpedoed into his land. Luckily for both farmers, the space waste – which came from one of the craft’s fins – was located a fair way from their homes.
Australian National University space expert Brad Tucker was called by authorities to inspect the object.
“This is most definitely space junk which was part of the SpaceX Crew-1 trunk,” he told Ben Fordham on radio. The space craft, which costs $62m per launch, has started to deorbit after almost two years in space.
