SIXTY organisations from Australia and across the world, including manufacturing giants Mitsubishi and Siemens, have put forward their ideas for the state government’s $593m hydrogen facility.
A market-sounding process that recently concluded invited proposals from industry on the technical, system and commercial project approaches for the Hydrogen Jobs Plan.
The Advertiser understands among the companies that submitted proposals were Fortescue Future Industries – the Australian green hydrogen start-up owned by billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest – and General Electric, as well as Mitsubishi and Siemens.
The new Hydrogen Power SA office will use the submissions to shape the final design and implementation of the project, and inform procurement processes and final site selection. Premier Peter Malinauskas, pictured, said “it is clear our bold vision for hydrogen has captured the imagination of the world”.
“The high interest in the market-sounding process has demonstrated the level of interest in the state’s hydrogen jobs plan, and leaves little doubt that the green hydrogen industry in Australia is on the up and up,” he said.
“We have positioned our state as a world leader in renewable energy, and the green hydrogen industry is the next step as we head towards net zero carbon emissions.” Hydrogen Power SA chief executive Sam Crafter said he was pleased with the number of responses received “from across the globe and here at home”. “We will continue to analyse the submissions over the coming days and weeks, and we look forward to working with industry to deliver the Hydrogen Jobs Plan,” he said.
