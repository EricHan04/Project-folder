THREE sets of skills have been dubbed “forever skills” as they have always mattered to human advancement and will continue to matter.  Forever Skills authors Kieran Flanagan and Dan Gregory believe technology skills may not future-proof careers, with coding skills, for example, set to one day follow the path of blacksmithing, as artificial intelligence and robotics advance to self-code.
They say evergreen skills such as creativity, communication and control skills, however, will continue to matter in the future.
CREATIVITY Being agile, adaptable and able to solve problems, using insights from data, forms the basis of creative skills, rather than being able to paint or draw. “Data isn’t the answer, it’s input,” Flanagan says. “This makes an ability to turn data into meaning and information into intelligence a critical skill.” Gregory says most people see problem solving as a skill they are or are not born with. “We confuse creativity with artistry,” he says. “A better definition of creativity is the capacity to solve problems in ways we haven’t seen before.”
COMMUNICATION Beyond effectively speaking and listening are team building, influence and translation skills.
“Building a team requires more than influence, it also demands an ability to understand and moderate team dynamics and negate politics,” Gregory says.
Flanagan says translating languages in a global world is more than understanding a foreign dialect. “Translation is really an ability to make information available and useful as it travels from one context to another,” he says.
CONTROL“The ability to regulate our own behaviour will be eternally important,” Flanagan says. “When we talk about resource management, it’s easy to think in terms of fossil fuels or renewables, however, this skill . . . includes human resources such as time and effort, and is ultimately a capacity to make judgment calls and to prioritise effectively.”
