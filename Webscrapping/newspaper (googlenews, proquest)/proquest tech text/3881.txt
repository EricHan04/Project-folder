Construction of the new Thomas Foods International meat processing plant near Murray Bridge has reach a milestone with the first above-ground building works under way.
Measuring 10-storeys high, the automated packaging building is being erected as part of more than 1700 tonnes of steelworks earmarked for the development.
As the highest structure to be located on site, the packaging building will have capacity to store 40,000 cartons of frozen and chilled meat products within the storage and retrieval system, and will feature the latest in automation and robotics technology.
The first stage will focus on beef facilities with sheep and lamb processing facilities to come later.
TFI group engineering manager Nekta Nicolaou said the level of visible construction activity on site would rise markedly during the coming months.
"Up until now, much of the activity on site has been focused on initial earthworks and the pouring of concrete footings and foundation," he said. "Two large lagoons have been excavated for our wastewater treatment plant.
"In total 180,000 cubic metres of soil is being moved around within the site as part of levelling earthworks, avoiding the need to import or export additional amounts.
"This site will become a hive of activity over the months ahead as the build continues to progress as planned."
Stage One is expected to be a 24-month process with the build anticipated to be finished late 2022.
TFI has already begun recruitment of the first management positions with more roles expected to open in the coming months.
