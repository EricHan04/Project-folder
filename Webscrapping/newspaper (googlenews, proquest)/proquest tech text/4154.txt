BAE Systems has showcased its autonomous vehicle technologies to the Australian army, providing an insight into how battlefields could operate in the future.
The “battlefield simulation” demonstration was last week held at the Majura Training Site near Canberra, where the Chief of Army observed the two M113 armoured vehicles in operation.
It follows a six-month project involving the installation of hardware and software in the vehicles by engineers and technicians based at BAE’s Edinburgh Parks facility. BAE Systems Australia chief executive Gabby Costigan said the company’s autonomous systems capability leveraged more than three decades of collaboration with the Federal Government through programs such as Nulka and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM).The M113 prototype will be used by the Australian army to experiment and better understand autonomous opportunities as part of its recently released robotics and autonomous systems strategy.
