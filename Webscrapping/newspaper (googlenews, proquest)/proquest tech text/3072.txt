If people would like to be transported to another realm and experience the world of fantasy and science fiction at a higher level, then a trip to the Murray Bridge Regional Art Gallery is a must.
On show is the Terminus exhibition, which is the work of international virtual reality artists Jess Johnson and Simon Ward, and was curated by the National Gallery of Australia.
Member for Barker Tony Pasin said Murray Bridge was able to host Terminus through more than $35,500 in funding from the Federal Government's National Collecting Institutions Touring and Outreach program.
"Terminus is a virtual reality based exhibition which presents a choose-your-own adventure into the technological," Mr Pasin said.
"Visitors navigate through a slippage of time and space as their journey propels them through five distinct realms at separate stations positioned within a floor map of technicolour pathways and symbols."
Murray Bridge gallery director Fulvia Mantelli said the current showing, until Sunday, January 17, would be the only time the exhibition would be in South Australia.
"As Murray Bridge Regional Gallery is the only South Australian host venue, this is a unique opportunity for our regional and city-based communities to experience this innovative exhibition," she said.
The free exhibition is also accompanied by an educational resource which is linked to the Australian curriculum.
- Details: The gallery is open Tuesdays-Saturdays, 10am-4pm, Sundays 11am-4pm. Closed Mondays and public holidays. It will be closed from December 24, 12noon, and reopen January 5.
