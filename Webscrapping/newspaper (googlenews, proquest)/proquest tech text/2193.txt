A BATTLE for control of energy storage technology company 1414 Degrees’ board has flared up again with major shareholder and former managing director Dr Kevin Moriarty attempting to roll the board for a second time.
1414 Degrees recently lost its second chief executive in as many years, with former leader Matthew Squire resigning in May for personal reasons after being appointed last July, and the company will now face a second battle for control of the board.
Companies associated with Dr Moriarty have called for a general meeting of the Adelaide-based company, with a view to removing Dana Larson, Peter Gan and chairman Tony Sacre from the board, and replacing them with Dr Moriarty himself and Ian Burdon.
Dr Moriarty launched a similar bid for control of the board in July last year, at a time when he was also a non-executive director.
That tilt was abandoned the same month and Dr Moriarty resigned from the board at that time.
1414 told the ASX late last week that it had reviewed Dr Moriarty’s application to call a general meeting and given that it was in order, it would call a meeting to be held on or before August 1.
Dr Moriarty’s company Focem Pty Ltd owns a 6.3 per cent stake in 1414. The listed company, which has been attempting to commercialise technology to store renewable energy for later use, stood down its former managing director Jamie Summons in May last year pending an investigation, however later finalised those investigations with no action taken.
1414 Degrees owns the Aurora Energy Project near Port August where it aims to develop a large scale renewable energy facility including a solar panel installation and a battery energy storage system using its own technology. The company had $4.5m in cash and no debt at the end of the March quarter. 1414 Degrees is valued at just more than $16m with the company’s shares trading at 7.8c.
