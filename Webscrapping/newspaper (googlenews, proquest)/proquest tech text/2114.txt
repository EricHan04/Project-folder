FIREPLACE manufacturer Nectre has unveiled its new facility in Cavan where it will design, manufacture, test and dispatch its products all under one roof. The facility, at 532 Cross Keys Rd, is partly run on renewable energy and will employ about 25 factory workers.
David Wain, the general manager of flame products at Glen Dimplex, Nectre’s parent company, said the company had been operating in South Australia since 1978.
“The first Nectre was built in a back shed more than 44 years ago,” he said. “Our roots are in South Australia, and while we’re now exporting internationally and picking up design awards locally, we haven’t forgotten where we’ve come from.
“The opening of this new factory in Cavan demonstrates our commitment to manufacturing in Australia.” Mr Wain said the company’s low emission woodfire heaters and fireplaces were built to “blend in with the Australian way of life”.
