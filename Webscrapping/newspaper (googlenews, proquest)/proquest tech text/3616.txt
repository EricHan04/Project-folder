A new campaign has been launched to encourage people to take action to reduce blood-lead levels.
Known as Augmented Reality, it is described as an "exciting initiative" by the Environmental Health Centre, in Gertrude Street.
The campaign runs through an interactive free app to promote ways to keep blood-lead levels as low as possible and encourage people to enrol in the centre's program.
The centre's community and family development team manager, Renee Harmer, said the project would promote lead awareness to the community in a modern and interactive way.
"Everyone can play a part in keeping blood-lead levels as low as possible, helping to give the children of Port Pirie the best start in life," she said.
The campaign is a joint initiative between the University of South Australia, University of Adelaide and SA Health through the centre.
The technology works through the free app. Once downloaded to a mobile device, it uses the camera function to bring a printed image to life.
