SCHOOL REPORT for kids + by kids TWO Geelong schools have qualified for this weekend’s, robotics VEX IQ Challenge national championships at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
A Year 8 team from Geelong Baptist College and a girls team and boys team from Oberon High School are among 46 teams competing for a chance to attend the 2020 world finals in Kentucky.
Geelong MP Christine Couzens met the teams on Tuesday at the Geelong Tech School for their final practice session.
Ms Couzens congratulated the schools on their success and said the Geelong Tech School had been a game- changer in assisting schools to provide local children with a first-rate STEM education.
The annual competition requires teams of primary and secondary students to design and build a robot that can win a game-based engineering challenge supplied by VEX Robotics.
The Geelong Tech School has helped local schools learn robotics and secure funding from Ford to assist with travelling costs for the competition.
Geelong Baptist College science co-ordinator Jenny Tiglias said the students had dedicated a lot of time during lunchtime and after school sessions to designing and building their robots.“It has been a fantastic opportunity for students to develop their skills in coding, design, teamwork, cultural understanding and friendship,” she said.
