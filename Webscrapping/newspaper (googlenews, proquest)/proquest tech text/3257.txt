Belili Valkyrie and Eliza Wuttke are making progress with their Art Squad projects, after being selected for the first ever regional team to network and build their creative careers.
The pair have just returned from a face-to-face meet up with the seven other regionally-based squad members in Adelaide.
Miss Valkyrie said in that time they had the chance to brainstorm, attend workshops, the fringe and festival experiences, and creative studios.
"It did feel like we knew each other, because we had seen and talked with everyone with the weekly video chats....we're all good friends now," she said.
They said the main aim of the trip was to set goals for the next six months.
"It helps to keep us all accountable, but the main aim was to keep the connections between the group alive," Miss Valkyrie said.
She said she hoped to gain skills to be a better teacher, especially with the group she facilitated, Passionis Arts.
"I want to learn to be a better facilitator with my arts group, and teaching but also learning how to collaborate and bring in artists that can teach something that I don't know about," she said.
Miss Wuttke said she was using the Art Squad to connect with other artists.
"I'm still in an experimentation phase...but I'm looking to build a creative career for myself," she said.
Miss Wuttke makes handbags and up-cycles furniture, and also paints.
"I would like to create a business from what I do...we can direct (the program) that way," she said.
The two year program will wrap up in October 2020, but both said it was unlikely to truly end there.
"We will still be connected, just not officially through the program," Miss Wuttke said.
The young women hope they will get to show the community what they are involved in, either through a potential community project or a collaborative exhibition.
