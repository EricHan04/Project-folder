TAKEOVERS A CONSORTIUM led by Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar and his investment banking wife Kim Jackson have increased their bid for renewable energy company Genex Power to $346m.
The couple’s Skip Essential Infrastructure Fund and partner Stonepeak increased their offer to 25c a share on Wednesday, which was enough for the Genex board to open the company’s books for detailed due diligence.
The Jackson-led consortium last month made a 23c per share bid for Genex, a 70 per cent premium to the previous closing price, but this non-binding bid was not enough to give them access to the books. Ms Jackson and former Macquarie Banker Darren Keogh, from Stonepeak, have met with Genex management and board several times since then, before making a higher offer on Wednesday. “After careful consideration of the revised indicative proposal the board considers that it is in the interests of Genex shareholders as a whole to engage further with the consortium,” Genex said. Genex shares rose 1c to 23c.
