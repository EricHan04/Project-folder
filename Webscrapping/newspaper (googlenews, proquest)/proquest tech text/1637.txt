THE Aussie stereotype of a hard day’s work on the farm, a building site, in the mines or a car factory has evolved.
They still offer workers opportunities for hard yakka – but with a modern twist. AGRICULTURE Government figures show farmer is the most common occupation, agtech is also creating roles in areas from automation to data science.
Farm management software company AgriWebb co-founder Kevin Baum says it can be an “uphill battle” attracting talent into agtech. “Most of our company doesn’t necessarily come from an agriculture background, you just have to be fired up about solving big problems,” he says.
TRADES For many trades roles, physical strength is not essential and hands-on skills are no longer enough.
Motor mechanics, for example, plug in computers to cars to diagnose and fix many issues.
Employers across the trades are increasingly looking for apprentices with technical and digital skills, favouring those who have studied IT and engineering subjects at school.
MINING Technologies such as augmented reality and IoT have become widespread in recent years.
Such changes mean tech-savvy workers are needed in the mining sector to drive remote operated vehicles and pilot drones.
MANUFACTURING While employment declines occurred last decade in such things as car and furniture manufacturing, it rose in food and beverage manufacturing. Job site Indeed career insights head Jay Munro says jobs lost because of automation are likely to be replaced by new positions, such as programming and fixing machines.
