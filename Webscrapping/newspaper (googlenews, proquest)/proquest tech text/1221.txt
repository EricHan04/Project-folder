BEING an astronaut is certainly up there for tricky occupations and most are aware of the challenges met with eating in space, so a heap of researchers are looking into how to make outdated space food a thing of the past.
Figuring out how crews of space explorers will access fresh healthy food is a real challenge and the University of Adelaide's Waite Research director Matthew Gilliham and School of Agriculture Food and Wine's Jenny Mortimer will provide an insight into this critical project tomorrow night at The Braggs Building, North Terrace campus.
With a hope of a new international space station orbiting the moon within five years, a lunar settlement this decade; and a crewed mission to Mars by 2040, there is a lot happening in the space but arguably the greatest current obstacle to long-term crewed space exploration is the difficulty of keeping fresh, healthy food on astronauts' plates.
Regularly resupplying the pantry from Earth isn't the simple option it seems, according to researchers and it's also not yet possible to keep large stores of food nutritionally stable in space for long periods of time.
Astronauts are basically going to have to grow their own food but that is pretty difficult to digest, so Professor Gilliham and Ass Prof Mortimer will discuss this topic and more, as well as try to understand how the required innovations could help improve the sustainability of food production on Earth.
The event is Free and starts at 5.30pm.
For those who cannot attend, there is a webinar Webinar Registration - Zoom and to register visit adelaide.edu.au/research/events/research-tuesdays.
