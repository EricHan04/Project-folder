With a program which spans ideas from the millennia-old wisdom of the Psalms and poetry of The Iliad to virtual reality technology, the Adelaide Festival’s 60th anniversary embodies both the tradition and innovation which made it world renowned.
For their fourth year, artistic directors Rachel Healy and Neil Armfield have sought out art which responds and reacts to a world in which they say “social systems are failing” and where much is “dysfunctional and broken”.
As it looks back over six decades of its history, the Festival also keeps an eye fixed firmly on the future, with works which question where we are now and inspire our capacity to move forward.
Alongside events profiled in this issue, here are some of the other anticipated highlights of next year’s program.
