A new research centre at the University of Adelaide will investigate ways of exploiting resources in space to make long-term exploration viable.
Solving the challenges of making long-term space exploration viable will be the focus of new research at the University of Adelaide.
The Centre for Sustainable Planetary and Space Resources will bring together experts to develop ways to sustainably use resources in space.
Its work stems from the conclusion that long-term space exploration requires a fundamental rethinking of technologies, processes and infrastructure.
“The next space revolution rests on the ability to produce materials and structures in space,” Associate Professor of Off-Earth Resources and head of the new centre John Culton said on Tuesday.
“Transporting resources into space is not viable for long-term space exploration, as mission payload costs are thousands of dollars per kilogram. 
"This provides the economic impetus to find viable solutions to locating, extracting and processing resources where they are found and doing so in a sustainable way.”
The new centre also comes as NASA works towards its next moon landing in 2024 at the start of a long-term presence on the lunar surface.
