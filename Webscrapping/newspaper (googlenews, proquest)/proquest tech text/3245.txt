DIVE into the Great Barrier Reef with Sir David Attenborough as your guide, journey beneath the waves in a Triton submersible and experience the natural wonderland with its vibrant corals, darting fish, and reef sharks.
SA Museum’s first virtual-reality experience opens today. It’s a 360-degree trip through the world’s largest coral reef.
SA Museum director Brian Oldman says he’s excited to bring the immersive virtual reality experience to Adelaide.
“This year we are introducing new ways for our visitors to experience the museum with a major focus on digital,” he said.
“Virtual reality is a brilliant way to transport us to different environments – like the Great Barrier Reef, which hosts an incredible community of life, with over 3000 reef systems.
“Visitors will be in awe of the wonder and beauty of the reef and who better to guide them than Sir David Attenborough himself.” Coral specimens will be on display.
Marine invertebrates senior collection manager Dr Andrea Crowther said the display would show the diversity of one particular type of coral.
“Scleractinian coral is a reef-building coral, which means its skeleton actually becomes the building blocks of the reef,” she said.
“The architecture of this framework then provides homes for other animals creating an amazing community for these organisms to thrive.” Created by Atlantic Productions and its studio Alchemy VR, the 20-minute experience using the latest technology from Oculus Go gives guests the opportunity to come face to face with the diversity and abundance of the Great Barrier Reef. Sir David has been a long-term supporter of the SA Museum.
The experience is not recommended for children under 13 or people with certain medical conditions. Glasses can be worn under the headset but the focus cannot be adjusted.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH'S GREAT BARRIER REEF DIVE VR IS AT THE SA MUSEUM UNTIL JULY 14 AT 11AM, NOON, 1PM AND 2PM DAILY. COSTS $16 ($12 FOR MEMBERS).
