A multi-venue block party, MAAD will take over laneways, public spaces and galleries in the northwest corner of the city from 4pm on July 31.
Illuminate creative directors Lee Cumberlidge and Rachael Azzopardi described MAAD as an “eclectic program”.
“We’ve teamed up with our favourite art spaces and music venues as well as Unsound, one of the world’s great festivals, to bring to Adelaide some of the most exciting new music and contemporary art on offer.”
Joining previously announced artists-in-residence The Avalanches, who will perform a DJ set on the outdoor stage in George Street, will be Melbourne DJ and fashion designer Soju Gang and South Sudanese born Adelaide hip hop artist DyspOra.
MAAD and experimental platform Unsound will also hold two ticketed events at Jive and the Lion Arts Factory.
Jive’s line-up includes HTRK, My Disco, Del Lumanta and Aviva Endean’s Vibrato Virtual, where attendees become part of a multi-speaker sound system using their mobile phones.
Lion Arts will host acts including Berlin based DJ Plead, New Zealand electronic artist Air Max ’97, video artist and cinematographer Capital Waste and Void, a new music video collaboration between Kenya’s Slikback and London’s Weirdcore.
The adjacent Breezeway Bar will feature a virtual reality installation by Adelaide artist Jess Taylor.
Nexus Arts will present percussive artist Matthias Schack-Arnott, composer and clarinetist Aviva Endean, and the Primordial soundscape by pianist and composer Gabriella Smart.
West End galleries will also open their doors from 5-9pm, for audiences to explore existing exhibitions at night, as well as specially programmed events.
Illuminate, which runs from July 16 to August 1, has also launched the program for Kinara, a free evening of First Nations music and culture at Tandanya on July 24.
