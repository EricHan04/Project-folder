WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has turned up the pressure on China over trade, threatening to hike tariffs on $285 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Mr Trump’s comments, delivered on Twitter on Sunday, came as a Chinese delegation was due to resume talks in Washington to resolve a trade dispute that has shaken financial markets.
Mr Trump said he would raise import taxes on $285 billion in Chinese products to 25 per cent from 10 per cent on Friday.
The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, said China was considering cancelling the talks. Beijing responded to previous US threats by saying it wouldn’t negotiate under pressure.
In January, and again in March, Mr Trump pushed back deadlines for a tariff increase to buy more time for a negotiated settlement. But on Sunday, the President, who has called himself a “tariff man”, said he was losing patience.
“The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Mr Trump tweeted.
In his tweets, Mr Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another $465 billion of imports, covering everything China ships to the US.
The countries are locked in a high-stakes dispute over China’s push to establish itself as a technological superpower. The US charges that China is resorting to predatory tactics – including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology – in a drive to establish Chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles.
The Trump administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress.A month ago, Mr Trump said the countries were “rounding the turn” and predicted that “something monumental” would be achieved in the next few weeks.
