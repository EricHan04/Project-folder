KICE Penneshaw students in Term 3 participated in the Primary Maths Association Competition. The six students are from Year 4 to 7 chose from a range of possible projects. Their submission for the challenge was an investigation into the North-South Corridor, the new road development along South Road in Adelaide.
The students analysed data in the media showing the North-South Corridor in a positive or negative light, argued in favour of a tunnel along South Road between Anzac Highway and the Torrens River. They created a community survey asking KI residents for their thoughts, and wrote a letter to the Transport Minister.
For our efforts, we received a Highly Commended award in our category! Congratulations to the six students who participated: Aiesha, Moni, Lilah, Dakota, Kirby and Rose. (Photo Pg 19). These six students are dedicated mathematicians who can use mathematical information in the context of normal people's lives. Well done! - James Mignone
Marley's trail Marley, a Year 4 student at the Kingscote Campus, chose to design a maths trail for her entry into the SA Primary Maths Challenge. She selected Reeves Point as her location and created a maths "Treasure Hunt", which required her classmates to look for clues and solve problems relating to sites at the historic location.
Marley said the hardest parts of the challenge were doing the research, completing lots of drafts and making last minute changes on the day. Marley received a Highly Commended Award for her entry and will travel up to Adelaide to receive her certificate from the Minister for Education, John Gardner.
