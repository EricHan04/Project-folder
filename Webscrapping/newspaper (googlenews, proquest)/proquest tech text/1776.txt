THE new financial year has ushered in a flurry of changes in the senior ranks of Adelaide’s mid-tier accounting firms.
At Brentnalls SA, co-founders Craig Farrowand John Crouchhave both stepped down from the partnership group, transitioning into consulting roles at the Hindmarsh firm.
Christina Gulliver, pictured, who has spent 14 years at the firm, has been promoted to partner.
Mr Farrow, who spent 12 years as managing partner and close to 20 years as chairman, said it was the right time to implement the firm’s succession plan.
“It feels like the right time to step away from the firm leadership, rebalance and be able to spend more time on my client advisory and director roles, and importantly family,” he said.
“Succession and opportunity for others in the firm has been a mantra of John and me. It has undoubtedly, together with deliberate growth and mentoring strategies, underpinned where the firm has got to.
Meanwhile at Pitcher Partners, six new partners have joined the firm’s national partnership team, including Chris Hanna, a management and tax advice specialist in the firm’s Adelaide office.
At William Buck, Andrew Barlowhas been promoted to the role of director within the firm’s wealth advisory division. It is the second promotion in two years for Mr Barlow, who joined William Buck in 2013 as a senior paraplanner. Also BDO Adelaide has welcomed Lachlan Kennettto the newly created role of director, private wealth. The firm has also promoted Michael Macolino to the position of associate director of agtech.
