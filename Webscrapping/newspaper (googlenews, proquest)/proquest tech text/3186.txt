VIRTUAL reality could help alleviate pain in a common procedure for pregnant women, a world-first medical trial has found.
A trial at Melbourne’s Monash University tested 50 patients who were fitted with virtual reality glasses during External Cephalic Version (ECV), which is a common procedure to reposition babies in preparation for delivery.
ECV is a procedure that requires the obstetrician to manually flip the baby’s head face down when a mother is 37 weeks pregnant. It is necessary for 3 per cent of births.
One of the doctors’ leading the trial, Dr Vinayak Smith, said virtual reality reduces the pain of undergoing the procedure through slowing pain impulses that act as a distraction for the brain.Dr Smith said: “The trial is the first in the world to use virtual reality for pain management in antenatal patients.”
