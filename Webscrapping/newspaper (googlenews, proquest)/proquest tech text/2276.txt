MORE than $600,000 in scholarship payments will go towards supporting Flinders University research projects in areas ranging from bushfires to renewable energy.
The university says 46 students will benefit from the Playford Memorial Trust Scholarship program – from first-year undergraduates to PhD researchers.
Among their focus areas are lasers, photonics, artificial intelligence and traffic management technologies.
Bachelor of Engineering honours student Shanique West will use her scholarship to model traffic flows at intersections and apply new intelligent transport systems, infrastructure and connecting vehicle technologies to minimise delays.
“I enjoy using the software to model the intersections and have been interested in transport infrastructure from watching major projects being constructed, such as the Darlington upgrade,” she said.
The scholarship program honour the state’s longest-serving premier, Sir Thomas Playford. It has supported more than 600 students over the past decade.
