THOUSANDS of South Australian families face at least a $50 increase in their annual power bill from July.
The tariffs households pay are expected to rise at least 10 per cent when the Australian Energy Regulator reveals Default Market Offers for 2022-23 on Thursday.
DMOs are the maximum consumers can be charged and the starting point for electricity retailers in calculating most of their rates for the new financial year. That means if DMOs go up, most retail prices go up too.
The Advertiser understands the regulator is likely to lift DMOs by at least 10 per cent.
In March, a draft proposal flagged a $53-a-year increase in SA for a household using 4000kWh. There were 65,516 households in SA on a default offer as of March this year.
The likely price hike for 2022-23 follows two years of falls. Since the draft proposal was released, Russia has invaded Ukraine, creating chaos in global energy markets and sending coal and gas prices soaring.
Major power companies have made submissions to the regulator arguing the wholesale electricity prices used to calculate the draft default offers were far too low. An increase in electricity tariffs presents a test for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who campaigned on promises to “cut power bills and reduce emissions by boosting renewable energy”.
