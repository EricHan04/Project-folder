ADELAIDE’S Tilda Cobham-Hervey is a likely inclusion on the red carpet at the Toronto Film Festival after I am Woman was selected to open the prestigious “special presentations” category.
The music biopic about the Australian singer Helen Reddy, whose anthem of independence became the torch song for feminists everywhere, is one of two Australian selections for Toronto which opens on September 5.
Another is True History of the Kelly Gang, from Peter Carey’s saga about the bushranger starring Russell Crowe and Nicholas Hoult, which was directed by Gawler-born film maker Justin Kurzel, inset, and co-produced by Adelaide’s Paul Ranford with Porchlight Films’ Liz Watts. Tilda’s much-anticipated performance in the lead role of the fiercely ambitious singer who in New York became a friend of Australian music journalist Lilian Roxon, played by Danielle Macdonald from Patti Cake$, will have its world premiere at Toronto with an Australian release expected later this year.Australian industry magazine FilmInk says Tilda – whose first film, 52 Tuesdays, won the Crystal Bear award at the Berlin film Festival in 2014 – gives a magnetic performance as Reddy, left, that will establish her as a major star. Tilda is also in the upcoming full-length virtual reality feature Lone Wolf, with Australian superstar Hugo Weaving. -PENELOPE DEBELLE
