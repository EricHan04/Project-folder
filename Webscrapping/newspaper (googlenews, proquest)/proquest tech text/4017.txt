JBS AUSTRALIA’S farm assurance and supply chain manager Mark Inglis told the Herefords Australia forum at Hamilton last week that DEXA-assisted robotic processing had made the DEXA technology viable at its lamb processing plant in Bordertown, South Australia.
But JBS was not likely to adopt DEXA technology in beef, he said. Instead, it was looking into other objective carcass measurement technology.
The efficiencies created through the robotic processing made DEXA viable on lamb, Mr Inglis said, paying back the technology within three years.
The company has also installed the product at Brooklyn, at a higher cost, and the pay-back period would be longer.
Mr Inglis said to economically justify installing DEXA it needed to be linked with robotic automation.
“That is where the cost benefit is,” he said.“If you put DEXA in purely to provide producer feedback, the payback is too long.”
