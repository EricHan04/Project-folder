ARMY vehicles will be converted into robotic tanks that can operate with or without a human crew in South Australia under a new $7.7m defence contract.
It is one of the first contracts announced since Prime Minister Scott Morrison unveiled a $270bn Defence step-up in July.
The contract, awarded to defence giant BAE Systems, will see 16 armoured personnel carriers converted into robotic “combat vehicles” that can be operated remotely without a human crew.
The upgrade will take place in SA and partly in regional Victoria over the next two years, giving Australia a fleet of 20 “optionally crewed combat vehicles”.
“These technologies are ‘disruptive technologies’ that provide marked advantages on the modern battlefield by bolstering ADF capability while protecting Australian personnel,” Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said.
She said robotic technology would be “central” to future humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and combat.
Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price said: “There is a global increase in the use of these types of technologies and investments like these ensure both Defence and Australian industry are well positioned to take advantage and further develop these state-of-the-art technologies.” It’s part of a $12.2m investment that will also go to research and small robots for reconnaissance.
