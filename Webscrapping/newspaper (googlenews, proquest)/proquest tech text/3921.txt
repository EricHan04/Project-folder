THE robots are already whizzing around Amazon’s first robotics fulfilment centre in the southern hemisphere.
It’s a huge warehouse in Sydney where Amazon will receive goods from manufacturers and distributors, store them, and then retrieve them to send to customers. Here, the storing and retrieving will be done by the robots.
Amazon Australia principal program manager Luke Rector said the Kemps Creek facility was just 12 hours’ drive from 80 per cent of Australia’s population. That’s anywhere from north of Brisbane to Melbourne along the eastern seaboard.
“It took 18 months to get us to this point,” Mr Rector said. “We’re at the point of testing and commissioning and getting ready to go live in the early part of next year.” Amazon’s newest fulfilment centre is huge by its own standards. It’s more than four times the size of the tech giant’s existing Sydney warehouse at Moorebank, which itself is compared to the size of six football fields.
Mr Rector compared the new 200,000sq m centre comprising four levels to the size of 24 rugby league fields. He said it was the largest warehouse built in Australia. “Predominantly this building will fulfil small to medium-sized products,” he said. “It won’t fulfil your larger TVs but it will fulfil your phones, your teddy bears, your Lego sets.” The statistics around this centre are staggering. Robot vehicles will move 37,000 yellow storage pods around the warehouse, which overall will store up to 20 million items sold on amazon.com.au. Amazon argues that the robots do not need to create spaces between the stored shelving units that humans would need. Mr Rector said this increased the density of storage and the warehouse capacity by more than 50 per cent. He said the site would create more than 1500 jobs ranging from IT and engineers to pickers and packers.
