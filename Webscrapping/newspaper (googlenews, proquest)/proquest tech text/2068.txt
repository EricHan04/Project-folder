SUBURBAN shoppers will be able to charge their electric cars in as little as 15 minutes, giving around 400km range for $40, thanks to a series of state government grants for trial charging stations.
Rather than relying on solar panels, the batteries that feed the stations will be powered from renewable energy pumped into the electricity grid – but will only be charged when demand is low, storing power for when EV-driving shoppers need it.
Announcing the plan at Foodland Pasadena Shopping Centre on Saturday, where a Planet Ark plan will see a 1000kW battery powering 14 charging stations, Infrastructure Minister Tom Koutsantonis said: “The transition is coming.” “This will become part of our day-to-day lives and will be part of our shopping,” he said, while graciously praising the previous Liberal government for its part in promoting renewable energy.
The grants will see electric vehicle smart-charging stations installed at sites including selected shopping centres, carparking stations, Flinders University, a winery and a caravan park. The trials will complement the statewide EV Charging Network being rolled out by the RAA, with more than 500 charging stations at 140 sites in 52 locations across South Australia.
Mr Koutsantonis said there were forecasts of up to 170,000 electric vehicles on South Australian roads by 2030, fuelling driver demand for charging options.
“We will be delivering them as we continue our world leadership in renewable energy,” he said.
“The electric vehicle smart-charging trials will contribute towards our target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. “Our government is taking huge steps toward reducing carbon emissions through the Hydrogen Jobs Plan investment of $593m.”
