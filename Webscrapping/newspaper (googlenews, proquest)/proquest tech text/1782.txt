THE need for farmers to become more effective communicators to maintain the trust of consumers was a recurring theme from the successful 2019 Growing SA conference hosted by Grain Producers SA and Livestock SA at Hahndorf today.
United States biotechnology expert Professor Kevin Folta from the University of Florida, who was one of the keynote speakers, encouraged the audience of 230 farmers and agribusiness participants to get on social media and share good information and science behind GM.
"Facts don't matter until you're trusted," he said.
National Farmers' Federation president Fiona Simson explained how the organisation was helping farmers deal with animal activists and farm invaders and the legislation being introduced or considered by states to strengthen their trespass laws.
She also stressed the importance of the livestock industry maintaining best practice and being able to show it.
Primary Industries Minister Tim Whetstone also addressed the conference, announcing the state government's plans for a new aggravated farm trespass offence and harsher penalties and enforcement of the existing trespass laws under the Summary Offences Act.
The afternoon session focused on AgTech, with guest speakers including Meat & Livestock Australia's Sean Starling, Farmers 2 Founders' Sarah Nolet and Telstra's Warren Jennings.
