Inkyu Sa Computer Scientist CSIRO Data61 Research leader in robotics A scientist with CSIRO's Data 61, Inkyu Sa, is an expert in deep learning, the technique that enables the computer brain of a robot to learn from experience.
The conventional way of programming a robot is to give it a set of instructions, laboriously written by human programs of the form "while this is happening, if you see this then do that".
Sa is going a step further, bringing deep learning to robots to give them the capacity to make new sets of instructions based on the success, or the failure, of the past. It means that robots can be trained, which will make them far more effective.
"The deep learning network does a really good job compared to the conventional approach," Sa says.
His expertise in this area attracted wide notice in 2016 when, as a post doctoral research fellow at Queensland University of Technology, he working on a deep learning robot that harvested fruit and vegetables. He was lead author on an influential paper, DeepFruits: A fruit detection system using deep neural networks, which was widely cited by other researchers. Harvey, the harvesting robot built by the QUT team, proved able to pick one capsicum every 30 seconds from a row of plants in a glasshouse.
Originally from South Korea, Sa worked at Samsung on the company's first Android smart phone before coming to Australia in 2010 to do his PhD at QUT.
He's now part of the CSIRO Data 61 team, which is competing in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, a global competition between 11 invited teams run up by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
It tests the ability of robots to autonomously navigate underground tunnels and caves, and find objects inside them.
He's now working on techniques to improve a computer's reliability in identifying things in photographs. It's an important ability for autonomous vehicles to master. Can one, for example, distinguish between a tree or a human no matter the time of day or weather conditions?
Sa says he "respectfully" disagrees with Elon Musk, who has said that fully autonomous cars will be ready next year or the year after.
"We have to make sure everything works 100 per cent, which is a really big challenge," Sa says.
"An autonomous car is driving in a very dynamically changing environment. Maybe it's raining, maybe there's lightning. There's a bunch of different scenarios we have to handle. "We don't want to drive over nine-year-old kids or 80-year-old grandmas and grandpas."
