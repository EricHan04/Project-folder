Meat & Livestock Australia's summer campaign for Australian lamb has launched, calling for Australia and New Zealand to come together over a lamb meal.
Building on the brand platform Share the Lamb, the campaign sets out to extend the 'rosemary sprig' to Australia's neighbouring nation and bridge the divide with lamb.
The campaign features a new long-form advert, based on a historical plan to originally have New Zealand as part of federation. This inspires two modern day Australian politicians to connect both countries again.
The stage is then set for both nations to come together for a lamb barbecue, among a huge floating party in the middle of the Tasman Sea. The comical advert celebrates the best of both nations and joins us together in New Australia-Land.
MLA domestic market manager Graeme Yardy said quality Australian lamb was front and centre of the campaign, while it also used the brand's trademark humour to encourage consumers to come together and share some Australian lamb.
"The good-humoured rivalry between Australia and New Zealand is something that underpins both countries' cultures," he said. "As a brand, lamb stands for unity, so we thought it was the perfect opportunity to bring both nations together over some tasty Aussie lamb."
The campaign will see the advert run across national metro and regional television, digital, social and radio while in-store, point-of-sale material will deliver meal inspiration.
