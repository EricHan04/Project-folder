THE last of the entries are trickling in for the 2022 Royal Adelaide Show grains and fodder competition.
RAHS grains and fodder committee member Bill Rowett said organisers were all keen to see the show back up and running.
"We're a big industry in SA and we've got an important role to play in educating city people and putting good news stories out about farmers," he said.
Fodder is the feature competition this year, with hay and chaff entries sent away for testing next week.
All of the customary classes will be judged in the Golden Grains Pavilion on August 18, including wheat, durum, barley, oats, pulses, small seeds, oilseeds and prepared seeds, while junior competitions will include baled hay and grain, and junior judging.
"We introduced junior classes for schoolchildren last year and we expect that to slowly grow," he said.
"It's an important addition as they're the future of our show."
Mr Rowett said while entries were down slightly on last year, he expected quality to be very good.
"However, we did miss out on some hay entries because there was rain in parts during the haymaking period," he said.
A grains and fodder photo competition will also be held, while the Golden Grains pavilion will host a virtual reality farming experience, displaying a brand new $250,000 hay baler and tractors, as well as state-of-the-art building panels made of oaten straw.
Awards will be announced at 3pm on Tuesday, September 6 at the Goyder Mezzanine.
