WANDERING a foreign city is a daunting experience but the intensity of the moment can help you learn the local language.
That’s part of the rationale for a groundbreaking trial at Athelstone School using virtual reality headsets to teach Italian to primary students. The students enter a 360-degree world with landmarks from around Italy and have to give and interpret instructions to navigate their surroundings.
“They might ask how can I get to a certain restaurant or where is the tower of Pisa,” Athelstone principal Gyllian Godfrey said.
Markers in the program reply with audio or written Italian.
Ms Godfrey said boys in primary school often get a bit bored and “don’t realise the joy of learning languages until much later in life”, but the technology was keeing them engaged.
Athelstone is one of five SA primary schools which received State Government grants of up to $50,000 to trial new ways to learn a language. Newcastle University will review the Athelstone project.
