Elon Musk’s Tesla big battery in South Australia has received approval to provide inertia services that can help stabilise the power grid when electricity supply and demand fluctuate.
Tesla’s Virtual Machine Mode technology uses power inverters to match up to half of the existing inertia services supplied by the state’s gas generators and soothe out any snags in the grid without the need for fossil fuel generation.
The 150 megawatt battery – known as the Hornsdale Power Reserve and run by French player Neoen – received approval from the Australian Energy Market Operator on Wednesday to deliver inertia services to the South Australian grid. “The closing of thermal power plants and increasing volumes of renewable energy are resulting in inertia shortfalls in the grid, a serious network issue that batteries are now able to overcome. In addressing these challenges, this innovative solution represents a breakthrough of global significance,” Neoen said.
The SA grid relies on renewables for 64 per cent of capacity with Hornsdale contributing an estimated 2000MW of equivalent inertia or around 15 per cent of the predicted shortfall.
Mr Musk, founder of both electric car giant Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX, first built the battery system in 2017 in record time after reacting to a Twitter challenge from tech mogul Mike Cannon-Brookes to help fix the state’s electricity problems following summer blackouts. Neoen estimates the battery has saved the national electricity market and SA consumers more than $150m since being switched on. Hornsdale Power Reserve – a subsidiary of Neoen – was fined $900,000 a month ago for saying it could provide back up services to the power grid when it couldn’t.
