ELECTRICITY prices for households have been falling this financial year, a special report by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia shows.
Average market prices dropped $111 a year from June last year, the report commissioned by Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan found.
The commission usually reports annually on average prices in the market. Its 2019-20 report found average market offer – the type of contract applying to more than 90 per cent of households – was $2086 a year.
Because most retailers dropped their prices at the start of this financial year, Mr van Holst Pellekaan, pictured, asked ESCOSA for an update.
The independent statutory authority found prices had dropped by $111 – or 5 per cent – to $1975 a year.
“We are putting hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of hardworking South Australians, which stimulates the economy and creates jobs,” Mr van Holst Pellekaan said.
“We’re delivering cheaper electricity, whilst also delivering the most ambitious agenda on climate action and renewable energy of any SA Government – 100 per cent net renewable energy generation by 2030.” Prices increased by $268 a year in 2017-18m compared to the year before then fell $62 and $96 and now $111 as at October 31.
The price falls are consistent with big decreases in the wholesale prices of generating electricity in South Australia, which reached 60 per cent supply from renewables last financial year. In 2019, wholesale spot prices averaged $109.80 a megawatt in SA. In 2020, they fell to $62.04 and in January and February this year are at $32.84, despite summer usually being a more expensive period.
