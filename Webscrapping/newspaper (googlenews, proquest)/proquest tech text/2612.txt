ThinkMarkets Australia analyst Carl Capolingua said it was a pretty quiet day on the local bourse, which basically tracked US futures lower.
Futures responded to US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell saying in a 60 Minutes interview it was ”highly unlikely we would raise rates this year”, which was surprising, Mr Capolingua said, given the central bank had “been more along the lines of ‘zero chance’ of a rate hike this year”.
All things considered, it was not a terrible performance on the ASX on Monday, Mr Capolingua said.
“Don’t forget we were up 3 per cent last week,” he said.
“There could have been a little profit taking out there today.
“We’re set up pretty well here: We’ve broken above key chart resistance at 6938, and we’ve got some really supportive fundamental factors behind us.
“Markets are always going to jump at the occasional shadow, but possibly the biggest risk for investors right now is not being invested ... I think you can keep buying these little pull backs.”
OpenMarkets Group chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said overall momentum has slowed after last week’s steady roll, but agreed the market was still looking strong technically.

“Banks have seen a strong recovery, fuelled by a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as a surge in new home loan applications.
“Financial stocks continue to outperform the broader market and have basically recovered the losses they incurred last year.”
