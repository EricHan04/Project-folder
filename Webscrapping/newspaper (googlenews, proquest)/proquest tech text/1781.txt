THE need for farmers to become more effective communicators to maintain the trust of consumers was a recurring theme at the successful 2019 Growing SA conference, hosted by Grain Producers SA and Livestock SA at Hahndorf on Tuesday last week.
Keynote speaker, United States biotechnology expert Kevin Folta, encouraged the audience of 230 farmers and agribusiness participants to get on social media and share good information.
National Farmers' Federation president Fiona Simson stressed the importance of maintaining best practice and being able to show it.
The afternoon session focused on agtech, with guest speakers including Farmers 2 Founders' Sarah Nolet.
