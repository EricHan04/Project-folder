A BAN on advertising, promotion and online sales of e-cigarette products comes into force today and retailers will not be allowed to display such products at the point of sale.
E-cigarette retailers have had a six-month transition period to make the required changes to their business following the passage of the laws in March, and from today will receive penalties for failing to comply with the regulations.
Penalties for businesses which fail to meet the regulations will be up to $20,000 for a first offence and up to $40,000 for a subsequent offence.
Minister for Health and Wellbeing Stephen Wade said the legislation was another step towards limiting pathways for young people to progress to both e-cigarette and tobacco smoking.In South Australia, it is an offence to sell or supply e-cigarettes to a person under 18, use e-cigarettes in a public smoke-free area, and to provide free samples, prizes, or gifts relating to e-cigarettes.
