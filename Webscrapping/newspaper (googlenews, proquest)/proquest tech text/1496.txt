LEARNING about agtech, flock profiling, ASBV's aiding better business decisions, and more was about 30 farmers and graziers from the Barossa region last month at a Keyneton on-farm focus field day.
Funding the Barossa Improved Grazing Group, Focus Farm Field Day was the PIRSA Red Meat and Wool Growth Program.
BIGG executive officer and host Georgie Keynes had an auto drafter on display for attendees to have a go.
A handful of University of Adelaide students also made the trip as part of their Agricultural Science degree.
Second year student Myfanwy Purslow said her knowledge of the opportunities within the industry expanded during the five presentations and one in-paddock demonstration.
