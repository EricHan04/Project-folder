SPACE debris is going to get a whole lot worse as thousands of new satellites are launched, a research paper has warned.
Flinders University space experts have called for international laws and treaties to be updated to keep pace with the rapidly growing Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite industry.
Space Industry Association deputy chairman Professor Melissa de Zwart and space law research associate Joel Lisk have found the number of satellites increased by 77 per cent in five years to 2019. By the end of 2020, it had increased by another 37 per cent to 3371 satellites orbiting Earth.
Mr Lisk said US billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX company already had approval to launch another 12,000 satellites, with a further 30,000 planned.
Other global companies such as Boeing were moving to start launching satellites in what Mr Lisk described as “a gold rush”.
“While there are laws that cover space activities, they are already under stress because of the speed at which the commercial space industry is developing,” he said.
In their paper, Prof Zwart and Mr Lisk said there was “real cause for concern” about the escalation of space junk.
“As the volumes of traffic in space increase, there is an increased risk of collision of objects, both active and inactive, in orbit,” they said.
“Collision events have the potential to create thousands of new pieces of uncontrolled debris in orbit … Australian regulation imposes no explicit requirement to avoid or reduce the possibility of collision.” The US Air Force already was tracking 16,000 pieces of space debris while in February a geomagnetic storm forced the atmospherical destruction of 40 satellites. Last month, a piece of a SpaceX satellite was found by a Snowy Mountains farmer in one of his paddocks.
