THE dusty periodic table will be brought to life thanks to a new app available in Australian classrooms from this week.
Instead of memorising the 118 elements, students can use an iPad to scan over the posters which then pops up key facts about each substance.
The posters are thanks to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, which distributed them to schools in a bid to get more kids interested in STEM careers.
The organisation’s chief executive, Dr Adi Paterson, said augmented reality apps could foster an interest in science that could lead to a lifelong love of the subject.
“This app is set to change Australia’s science class rooms as we know them, helping to foster an interest in science that could lead to a lifelong love, and even exciting career paths,” he said.
“Every single ANSTO periodic table, in every science classroom in Australia can from today be used to activate the augmented reality app, which is free to download.”Science and Technology Minister Karen Andrews said science subjects needed to be appealing to attract people into those careers.
