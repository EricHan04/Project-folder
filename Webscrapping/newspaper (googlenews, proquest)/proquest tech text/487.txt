CHINA should not be in a position to build 95 per cent of the world’s solar panels just as renewable energy is about to go global, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will warn on Thursday.
Without mentioning China by name, Mr Albanese will say one country already made 85 per cent of the world’s solar panels, and would make 95 per cent if nothing was done.
Speaking at the CEDA state of the nation conference, he will stress the importance of Australia ramping up its domestic manufacturing efforts. “Every solar panel in the world would contain some form of intellectual property driven by Australian research, developed by Australian scientists yet we haven’t commercialised that opportunity,” Mr Albanese will say.
