Tarneit ALDI shoppers are in for a treat once a major store upgrade is complete.
The store will close temporarily between October 2 and 16 for construction. The new-look ALDI, at Wyndham Shopping Centre, will include better product displays, improved navigation and modern styling.
An ALDI Australia spokesman said many of the improvements had been implemented following extensive store trials and a statewide rollout of the modern store design in South Australia and Western Australia.
“While we’re delighted to be introducing these innovations, we want our customers to know they won’t lead to higher prices,” he said. “Low prices are a big deal for ALDI … This is our fundamental point of difference and one we will never give away.”
New features will include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays, as well as extended energy efficient chillers and LED lighting throughout.
There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
“At ALDI, we offer a supermarket experience that is like no other in Australia, and it’s our differences that allow us to bring unbeatable value to our customers every day,” the spokesman said.
“We’re excited to be undertaking these upgrades and welcome the community to visit our new store from October 16 and share their feedback about the store experience.”
While ALDI Tarneit closes temporarily, shoppers can visit ALDI Tarneit Central located at 540 Derrimut Road for their grocery needs.
ALDI Tarneit will continue to be supported by a team of 15-20 permanent full and part-time employees.
