HALLETT COVE Here’s a chance to take a dive off the South Australian coast without even getting wet.
As part of Science Week, a new virtual reality experience will substitute the need for snorkelling gear – and allow everyone the opportunity to explore SA’s reef systems.
The 14-minute video – featuring footage taken by event organiser Carl Charter – will allow viewers to discover the beauty of our local marine life.
“I have always wanted to have people experience marine life below South Australia’s water line. It isn’t possible for everyone – some people are too young to go snorkelling, they have a disability or they’re too old,” Mr Charter says.
Putting on the VR headsets will immerse people in a watery world alongside sea critters like squid, jellyfish, sea lions, sharks and sea dragons.
Bella Koch, 12, was among a number of children to have a sneak preview of the video last week. “It was very real,” she says. “You saw a lot of marine life. It is definitely something you don’t see every day.”Cove Civic Centre, Hallett Cove, Saturday, August 10, 10.30am-5pm, and Sunday, August 11, 1.30pm-5pm. Cost: $4 plus booking fee.
