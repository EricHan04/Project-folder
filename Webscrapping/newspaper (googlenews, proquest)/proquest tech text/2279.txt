ENERGY ANDY Vesey, just four months into his role spearheading Andrew Forrest’s global bet on green hydrogen, admits the pace has been frenetic.
“We’re putting flags in a lot of places and we’re running like crazy,” Mr Vesey said from the US city of Denver.
“We literally feel like we’re under the gun for time. Waiting until 2050 is too late. We’ve got to get going now and we can’t just sit back and wait for it to naturally evolve.” To help fast-track its vision, Fortescue Future Industries opened a technology hub in Colorado on Friday that aims to develop green hydrogen and decarbonise hard-to-abate industries that can be quickly commercialised.
The hub will combine experts from Colorado universities and institutions, including the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and help FFI deliver on green hydrogen dreams which have been questioned by energy giants including Shell. FFI may expand into manufacturing its own green technologies including solar panels, cables and batteries, Mr Vesey said.
