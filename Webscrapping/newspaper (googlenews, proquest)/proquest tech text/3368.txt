The Adelaide Fringe is becoming virtual, lifting the curtain on its first Electric Dreams event.
Lot Fourteen, the old RAH site on North Terrace, will become a Fringe venue to showcase cutting edge, virtual reality work from around the world as well as playing to host a conference for artists.
The first Electric Dreams, from February 19 to 21, will feature VR experiences from film director Andy Serkis’ The Imaginarium Studios, the UK’s The Royal Shakespeare Company, Peter Jackson’s NZ special effects company WETA and America’s Magic Leap, presented in a VR cinema and across the road at the Masonic Lodge.
“Electric Dreams is a chance for creative practitioners to see how digital developments could be applied to their work and for the wider public to see mind blowing work from some of the world’s most innovative immersive storytellers,” says Fringe Director Heather Croall, below.REGISTRATIONS AND TICKETS: ADELAIDEFRINGE.COM.AU
