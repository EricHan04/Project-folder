QUICK SINGLES WITH JAMES PHELPS
DONATIONS for the McGrath foundation continued to be made long after stumps on “Pink Day” and the total is approaching a staggering $3 million.
Amid fears the COVID-crippled Test would hurt the charity’s biggest fundraising event of the year, the record of $1.7m was shattered with the help of “virtual” seats.
Almost 100,000 cricket fans paid $20 for a virtual seat in an innovation that ensured the McGrath foundation’s fight against breast cancer would continue.
FATHER AND SON He may have put his promising cricket career on hold but it appears Austin Waugh (pictured),hasn’t lost his love of the game.
The son of Australian legend Steve, Austin, 21, cheered on the Aussies at the SCG with his father.
The promising grade cricketer and junior representative player didn’t play this summer after taking time out.
PAT ON THE BACK Pat Cummins is destined to hold on to his No.1 ranking as the world’s best Test bowler after terrorising the Indians in the first three Tests.
While he hasn’t taken a five-wicket haul this series, he has now bagged four twice after 4/29 in the first innings.
JASPRIT DUMMY SPIT Umpire Paul Wilson has had to take a school master’s approach to dealing with players during this Test.
After being the focus of Tim Paine’s expletive-laden rage against the DRS system, Jasprit Bumrah earned the official’s displeasure.
Frustration got the better of Bumrah as chances he created were being dropped. The Indian paceman knocked the bails off at the non-striker’s end for no reason when walking back to his mark.
