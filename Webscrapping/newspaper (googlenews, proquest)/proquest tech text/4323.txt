ALDI's Rutherford store will soon reopen after undergoing an extensive upgrade.
The Hillview Street premises will throw its doors open on Tuesday, August 6 with a fresh new look, including better product displays, improved navigation and modern styling, a company spokesperson said.
Many of the improvements have been implemented following extensive store trials and ALDI's state-wide rollout of its modern store design in South Australia and Western Australia.
This is the company's first major group store transformation in 17 years which is currently making its way across the eastern seaboard.
"While we're delighted to be introducing these innovations, we want our customers to know they won't lead to higher prices," the spokesperson said.
"Low prices are a big deal for ALDI. In fact, we refuse to be beaten on price.
"This is our fundamental point of difference and one we will never give away."
New features include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays, as well as extended energy efficient chillers.
As energy management remains a key priority for ALDI, the store has energy efficient LED lighting. There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
The transformation is a reflection of the shifting expectations of Aussie shoppers, who are now more focused on the in store experience and finding a supermarket that caters to changing food preferences.
"We're excited to be undertaking these upgrades and welcome the community to visit our new store and share their feedback about the store experience."
The Rutherford store, which opened in 2007, employs a team of 15 to 20 permanent full and part-time employees.
