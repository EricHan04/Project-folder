GLOBAL transportation robotics outfit Super­pedestrian is bringing its advanced fleet of e-scooters to Australia and chief executive Assaf Biderman is confident that, unlike bike-sharing programs before it, its vehicles won’t end up in the river.
The US-based company, which began life as a spin-out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has now rolled out its LINK e-scooter sharing program to 30 cities globally, and is zooming into Australia next.
Its scooters, accessed through a smartphone app, will be racing across numerous local cities and regional towns before the end of the year.
“Demand for transportation is exploding worldwide,” Mr Biderman said. ”Vehicles are going to have to shrink, because there is limited space on our roads and demand is only going up.” Superpedestrian has spent eight years on research and development, building what its CEO described as the first and only comprehensive software operating system for a vehicle.
That‘s its “special sauce”, according to Mr Biderman, with the software performing 1000 health checks every second during the electric scooter’s rides.
The company’s LINK scooters last about 100km between charges. Superpedestrian’s scooters will be launching first across Melbourne and regional Victoria, the Gold Coast, Rockhampton, Adelaide, Launceston and Hobart, with more cities to come.
