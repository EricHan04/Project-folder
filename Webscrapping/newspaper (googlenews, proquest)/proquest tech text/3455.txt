AUSTRALIA'S COMMUNITIES PRESERVING OUR MILITARY HISTORY
COMMUNITY groups and organisations across the country that are committed to preserving Australia's wartime heritage as well as involving the community in projects and activities that commemorate our service personnel will share in more than $2.2 million in funding through the Saluting Their Service commemorative grants program.
Minister for Veterans' Affairs Darren Chester said this funding will help community groups and local organisations remember the service and sacrifice of our service men and women and support the community to participate in these commemorations.
"Australian service men and women in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations for over a century have played a role in shaping the nation," Mr Chester said.
"These commemorations, projects and activities ensure their story is captured for generations to come.
"The successful community groups and organisations in this round will also be the first to benefit from the Federal Government's election commitment which saw the Community Grants cap lifted from $4,000 to $10,000."
The Australian Government provided additional funding to the Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants Program as part of its continued commitment to commemorating the moments that shaped Australia's military history, such as the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 15 August - Victory in the Pacific Day.
"This year we have the unique opportunity to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and the around one million Australians who served and some 39,000 who died," Mr Chester said.
"Remarkably some 12,000 of those veterans are still alive today.
"It has been fantastic to see the creative ways that community groups are commemorating Second World War veterans in their home towns to ensure the memory of our service men and women lives on.
"These include digital honour rolls to commemorate local military personnel, creating an outdoor learning space that promotes recognition, appreciation and deeper understanding of the service and sacrifices of Australian military personnel, and a diorama exhibit to commemorate HMAS Australia and its role in the Pacific during the war."
The Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) recognises the potential impact COVID-19 may have on recipients completing their projects, with social distancing and other public health measures in place across the country. DVA is committed to working with recipients who are affected on options to continue their projects. If you are a current grant recipient and COVID-19 has impacted your project, please contact your Funding Arrangement Manager to discuss options.
A list of all successful applicants can be found below. For more information on the Saluting Their Service grants program visit the Community Grants Hub (www.communitygrants.gov.au)
