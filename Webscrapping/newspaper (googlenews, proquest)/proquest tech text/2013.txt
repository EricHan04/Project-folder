THE federal government will provide $50m in Tuesday’s Budget for Hobart’s zinc smelter Nyrstar, providing job security for hundreds of workers.
Nyrstar is planning a $400m modernisation of its 100-year-old smelter which is expected to start later this year.
The company says the modernisation will secure the long-term sustainability of 650 jobs in Hobart and a further thousand jobs at its operations at Port Pirie in South Australia.
It also believes the upgrade will support jobs for more than 5000 people in direct supply chain companies in Tasmania and regional South Australia.
Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic said Nyrstar was an important contributor to the Tasmanian economy.
“This delivers on our commitment to the people of Tasmania to support local manufacturing and local jobs in an industry vital for our transition to a renewable energy ­future.” He said Nyrstar played a “vital role in the production and supply of metals such as zinc, lead, silver and copper”.
