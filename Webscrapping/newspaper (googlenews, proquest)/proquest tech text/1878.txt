A SIGNIFICANT milestone has been achieved in pursuit of a “zero cost” energy future with an additional 1300 solar photovoltaic panels across the Eyre Peninsula.
With more than 35 locations, including Port Lincoln, Kimba, Lock, Arno Bay and Caralue Bluff, the roof and ground mounted panels are among 500,000 panels that are being installed in SA to generate 242 gigawatt hours of electricity.
SA Water’s senior manager Nicola Murphy said the new Eyre Peninsula solar arrays would produce a combined 770MW hours of green energy each year.
“This focus on green energy will also deliver positive environmental benefits, with the power generated by solar the equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by around 340 tonnes annually,” Ms Murphy said. “Now capturing the Eyre Peninsula’s winter sun and supplying electricity to power our storage tanks, pump stations and Port Lincoln depot, these solar arrays are well positioned to make the most of high solar radiance during the brilliant Port Lincoln summers.” Ms Murphy said the virus pandemic had not slowed the construction of the solar sites.
