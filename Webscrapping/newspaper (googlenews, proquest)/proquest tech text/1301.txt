SIR Richard Branson wants to to launch a mission to Mars or Venus in partnership with the Federal Government.
The billionaire is also keen to bring his space company, Virgin Orbit, to Australia, along with its unique air-launch system which uses a modified Boeing 747 to send rockets into space from midair.
Mr Branson’s brimming enthusiasm for the nation’s emerging space industry is detailed in Virgin Orbit’s submission to a government inquiry exploring how to best develop a sector which has been identified as a priority manufacturing area.
Virgin Orbit urges the government to support “ambitious beyond earth-orbit, deep space exploration missions” and suggests destinations include “cislunar space, Venus, Mars, or beyond”. “In addition to providing a near-term milestone achievement for the country’s new Space Agency, such a mission would provide access to space for start-ups in Australia, and would help bolster the Australian aerospace industrial base, furthering Australia’s position in analytics and science,” the submission says.
