TECHNOLOGY USED IN ORGANIC ENTERPRISE WITH the rapid advancement of non-chemical crop protectants and crop health technologies, modern organic farming methods are beginning to look very different from the ways of the past.
One organic farming family at Nadda, south-east of Loxton in South Australia's Mallee region, is embracing agtech and the opportunities it can bring to their cropping program.
In particular, Josh and Peri McIntosh are collaborating with a nearby organic farming family in trialling camera-guided inter-row cultivation as a way to control weeds.
"We leased a European inter-row cultivator in 2015 and found the guidance worked very well, but the mechanical components didn't suit our conditions," Mr McIntosh said.
"So we built a hydraulic side-shifting headstock and fitted an off-the-shelf camera guidance system and hydraulic control unit from the United Kingdom.
"We then designed cultivator wheels to lightly work the inter-row ridge while preserving the typical no-till ridge and furrow profile on 14-inch row spacings.
"But it is only 5 metres wide, which makes it hard to get over a lot of country. But if it continues to prove itself in trials, we'd look to scale it up."
The accuracy of the camera enabled accurate cultivation between disk seeder rows at just 170-millimetre spacing in 2015.
It cleans up weeds with a system of rigid finger wheels, which lightly work up the inter-row area, killing any emerging weeds.
