AFTER previously being postponed due to COVID-19, premier SA agtech conference AdvanceAg has been rescheduled to October 17-18, at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
The conference will bring together farmers, cutting-edge technology, businesses, developers, researchers and innovators.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham said the October AdvanceAg event would adhere to all COVID-19 protocols in SA.
"The SA government has continued to work with our keynote speakers and other important stakeholders who were due to come from overseas, interstate and across our regions, to ensure AdvanceAg can proceed," he said.
"AdvanceAg will feature some of the brightest minds in the world of agricultural technology demonstrating how new innovations can help solve real-world problems."
