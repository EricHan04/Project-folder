Solar panels touted to offset up to half of the Adelaide desalination plant's power bill will be built at the former oil refinery site south of the city, as part of SA Water's plans to install 500,000 panels statewide.
The utility has agreed to purchase 14 hectares of land at Port Stanvac, where crude oil was refined from the 1960s until 2003 ahead of its permanent closure by Exxon Mobil in 2009.
SA Water's Nicola Murphy said the installation of 35,000 solar photovoltaic panels at the site would generate an average of 21 gigawatt hours of electricity per year & reduce the utility's carbon emissions by 10,710 tonnes annually.
She said arrays of two-metre by one-metre solar panels would be fitted to a fixed-tilt racking system on an east-to-west axis.
"In times of higher rainfall, when the plant operates in a low production mode, the combined solar generation & battery storage will provide more energy than the facility requires & return the excess to the National Electricity Market," she said.
Desalination's big power bill
The Adelaide desalination plant has been in operation since 2012.
Construction began in 2009 in response to the millennium drought when capital cities across the nation made similar investments.
It was originally designed to provide up to 50 gigalitres of water for metropolitan Adelaide per year, but the SA Labor government struck a deal with the federal Labor government to double its output to 100 gigalitres.
By the time the $1.8 billion plant was operational, however, the drought had broken, meaning the plant has since operated in minimum production mode or switched off entirely during wetter months.
But even then, it costs SA Water about $13.5 million (in 2016-17) a year.
This bill is set to rise after the State Government agreed to crank up the plant late last year to produce 40 gigalitres of water up to June 30 as a drought relief measure to assist the eastern states & reduce take on the River Murray.
The increased costs will be covered by the Commonwealth.
Plans for 500,000 solar panels
Ms Murphy said SA Water planned to install 500,000 solar panels across 37 of its sites to produce 242 gigawatt hours of electricity & 34 megawatt hours of battery storage.
She said 130,000 panels had been installed at the Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant & at pumping stations that moved water from the Murray to Whyalla on the Upper Eyre Peninsula.
Ms Murphy said it was part of SA Water's "zero-cost energy future initiative" which would utilise renewable energy assets with a 25-year design life.
SA Water's drinking water & wastewater pumping & treatment operations in the dry year of 2018-19 drew a total electricity bill of $83 million.
