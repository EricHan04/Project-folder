Four Camden Haven High School students spent their school holiday time competing in the Open Soccer division of the Robocup National Championships.
The NSW champions, team 'Dam Rad' made up of Year 11 students Kyla Bradford and Adam Partlett flew to Adelaide to compete with team 'Crazy Kracken' consisting of Aurora Briscoe and Zion Cooke of Year 7.
Both teams did their best especially up against a Year 12 team from Brisbane Boys College (BBC) who had previously attended the World Robocup Championships.
'Dam Rad' sadly sustained too much damage and had to forfeit a game towards the end, relegating them to fourth place.
'Crazy Kracken' however finished the competition with one robot still standing up against the BBC team.
'Crazy Kracken' have been named as the first reserves as Australian Representatives at the Robocup Open Soccer World Championships in Bordeaux, France in June 2023.
