A large crowd of dairy farmers were on hand to hear from a range of international and Australian experts on what the future holds for feed availability and the potential of robotics to ensure feed efficiency is maximised.
The guests also heard from recently-appointed DairySA regional manager Tom O'Grady and Dairy Australian managing director David Nation about how the situation is looking for the industry.
Mount Gambier chiropractor David Beltakis also provided a range of exercises and advice to help minimise injuries while working on-farm.
