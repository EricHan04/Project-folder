ARTHRITIS sufferers are being invited to step into a world of virtual reality to “see” how their pain works in an effort to help them deal with it more effectively.
The 21st-century approach to a condition dating back millions of years – it has been found in dinosaur fossils – is part of a new partnership between the University of South Australia and Arthritis SA.
It is set to challenge myths surrounding the debilitating condition, suffered by 2.2 million Australians, and promote options, such as diet and exercise, ahead of surgery.
UniSA postdoctoral researcher Felicity Braithwaite has been named the inaugural John Stuart Colville Fellow, and will research on musculoskeletal pain. Made possible by a bequest to Arthritis SA, the fellowship will help Dr Braithwaite use virtual reality to educate people living with osteoarthritis about the pain system. “By engaging their senses through light and sound, we hope to illustrate how pain works and how it can be successfully managed through exercise as a viable option to surgery,” she said.
