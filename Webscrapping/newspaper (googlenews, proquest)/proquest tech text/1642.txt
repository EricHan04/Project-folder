THE livestock sector gathered at Kapunda earlier this month to engage in a series of discussions about the exciting future for producers with technology implementation.
Delivered by the Red Meat and Wool Growth Program, a plethora of speakers highlighted some of the sector's success stories and areas for improvement to evoke renewed motivation.
To help explain the role of AgTech in improving business performance, ProAdvice Services Chris Scheid gave producers a look into how to crunch numbers and make a better profit and Achieve Agriculture Solutions Nathan Scott asked the room whether or not they considered eID as the way forward and gave tips on how to make it work best.
