Construction has commenced on a major renewable energy project at Port Augusta.
Iberdrola's $500 million 317 megawatt hybrid wind and solar farm at the Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park broke ground on October 9, while Nexif Energy has begun its $170 million stage two expansion at the Lincoln Gap Wind Farm.
Premier Steven Marshall and Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan got a close-up look during their visit.
The Iberdrola project is expected to take 18 months to complete and Mr Marshall said this project, plus the Lincoln Gap Wind Farm, would place South Australia in an important energy position.
"It's a vitally important project, not just for local jobs but for our nation as we move to a more stable form of renewable energy going forward," he said.
"We are really pleased to have this project come into South Australia and we're very grateful for Iberdrola's significant investment of $500m in this new facility that will be here for decades and decades to come."
