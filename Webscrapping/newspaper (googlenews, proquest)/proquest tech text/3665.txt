FLINDERS University is calling all young explorers who want to get their hands dirty during a day of fun at Springfest tomorrow.
In partnership with NaturePlay Australia, SpringFest gives kids the opportunity to get their hands dirty and get interactive with the Thinking Caps science Show to open their creative minds among activities on campus.
Flinders University spokeswoman Castilla Thillou said the campus prided itself on opening its doors to the community.
“It is so important now more than ever to instil an interest, a passion or an awareness of science and STEM in future generations,” she said.
Visitors can hold a five million-year-old fossil, play in an augmented reality sandbox, and watch live international performances, including an African drumming band and Indonesian dance classes.
Science Alive will also showcase loud and messy demonstrations to inspire little scientists.SpringFest is on campus at Flinders University, from 10am to 3pm, and is free of charge.
