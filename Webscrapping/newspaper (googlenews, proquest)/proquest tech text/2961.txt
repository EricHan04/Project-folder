The Walkway Gallery is sharing its space with IlluminateAdelaide's Lacunae display, connecting Bordertown, Murray Bridge Regional Gallery and the South Australian Museum.
The motion-sensored space projects a figure mirroring of each person's movement onto the screen, sharing the dancefloor in real-time.
Arts and Culture Director for the Walkway Gallery, Naomi Fallon said the Gallery's interactive exhibit was putting Bordertown on the map. Lacunae features art from the Tasmanian tech-art collective Soma Lumia and music from local Jesse Budel.
The exhibit works best when a single person interacts with the display at a time, as motion sensors are able to project them into a virtual landscape with others in South Australia.
Speakers are connected with motion detectors and start playing when a person is in the space, and people are encouraged to dance.
The IlluminateAdelaide Lacunae opened on Friday July 15, and will close on Saturday July 30 and is free to the community.
