WEST BEACH
A MULTIMILLION-dollar, purpose-built training facility for children aspiring to play AFL – and adults who never gave up the dream – has opened next to Adelaide Airport.
The brainchild of Geelong premiership player and former Crows player and assistant coach James Podsiadly, AFL Max is the first of its kind in Australia and describes itself as an “immersive skills and entertainment centre”.
It was enough to lure Podsiadly out of the Adelaide coaches’ box following the 2017 grand final and into the project full-time.
The 5000sq m site has seven areas including a synthetic training pitch, interactive screens, tackle and bump bags, climbing walls, trampolines and virtual reality where footy fans can put themselves into an AFL grand final.
It’s also hoped the centre will become an attraction for international visitors wanting to learn more about the game.
“The light bulb moment was when I was coaching at the Crows. I used to see kids, coaches and players come into the club and try to jump on the speccy bag, kick the ball at targets and have a whole heap of fun,” Podsiadly said. “And I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to create an elite facility for people to have fun and develop their skills’.
“The venue is for everyone – our core market is kids but at the same time we’ve had adults and corporate groups who are inquiring about the facility and senior football clubs who can use it for training.” Podsiadly says he believes, from his research, the training centre is the first of its kind in the world. He had been happy coaching but the idea of AFL Max took off and required his full attention.“It was a tough decision to make because I really enjoyed coaching,” he said.
