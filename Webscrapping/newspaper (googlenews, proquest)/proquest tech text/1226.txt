WOMEN are being encouraged to reach for the stars – literally, thanks to an Adelaide VogueCodes event.
Earlier this week 40 women gathered for breakfast at 2KW Bar and Restaurant to discuss Australia’s future in space exploration.
The morning was chaired by Vogue Australia editor-in-chief Edwina McCann. The guest speakers were former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop, who is now chancellor of the Australian National University, and Australian Space Agency director of space technology Katherine Bennell.
The three talked about where Australia was at in space and its future possibilities.
And, as all Vogue Code events do, it encouraged women’s participation in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
Katherine, pictured with Edwina and Julie, spoke candidly about her work-life balance sometimes being a juggling act. “I’ve definitely spent a few 5 or 6am mornings with my kids in front of the TV, throwing snacks at them while negotiating deals with NASA,” Katherine said, laughing. Julie spoke of incredible women taking the industry by storm and the fundamental impact that careers in space can have for not only our future, but also our everyday lives.
