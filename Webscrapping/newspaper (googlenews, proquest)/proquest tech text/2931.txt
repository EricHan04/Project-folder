AEROMETREX’S $25 million initial public offering has attracted strong investor interest, closing “many times oversubscribed” ahead of next month’s debut on the ASX.
The Glynde-based aerial mapping company offered 25 million shares through brokers, priced at $1 a share.
The company is expected to list on the ASX on December 10 with a market capitalisation of around $95 million.
Managing director Mark Deuter said the company’s reputation for innovation, and its a point of difference from competitors in terms of the quality and accuracy of its mapping services, resonated with investors. “The very high pre-listing market interest in our IPO reflects a strong reputation, focused R&D and a proven record of building revenue, net profit, market share, customer base and operating footprint,” he said. “The proceeds of the IPO will be applied to growing our domestic and global aspirations and particularly our subscription service, which is emerging as a core focus of the business and is a growing revenue stream.
“Aerometrex has always been at the forefront of spatial technology advances, and we have sought to take this competitive advantage to new markets outside of Australia.”Mr Deuter will emerge with a 12.1 per cent stake in the company, while the board and management will control about 54 per cent.
