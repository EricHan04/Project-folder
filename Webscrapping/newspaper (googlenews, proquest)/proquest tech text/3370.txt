BACK in the 1980s it was a Jane Fonda workout played on the television’s trusty VHS player – fast forward almost 40 years, and it’s high-intensity cardio, virtual reality-style.
The Parks Recreation & Sports Centre in Adelaide’s north west has become the first YMCA site in the state to offer the new-age, hi-tech approach to group fitness.
It means groups of friends can choose to do a workout in front of a life-size, three dimensional computer-generated instructor, whenever they want, 24 hours a day.
YMCA area manager Craig Hortin says the “modern, innovative exercise platform” has proved to be more popular than expected.
“(It provides) huge flexibility across the schedule to work out when it suits you … members can still choose to come to a (regular) instructor-led class or if they can’t make a scheduled class, this provides them with another option to work out to the program they love,” he says.
Mr Hortin says the YMCA, which focuses on youth aged 12 to 25 years, opted to embrace the technology as a way of broadening its fitness options.YMCA chief executive Hayden Robins says it is vital to keep young people engaged in fitness through to adulthood. “The participation levels of young people in sport and recreation activities ... decreases substantially around the age of 15 – and this is more prevalent with young females,” he says. “We know if we can keep them engaged through these critical years ... they will take that through the rest of their lives.”
