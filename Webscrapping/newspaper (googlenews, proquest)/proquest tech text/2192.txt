RIO Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm has weighed in on the election-season energy debate, saying the development of renewable energy sources needs to be accelerated to cope with the exit of coal-fired power plants.
Rio is one of the biggest energy users in the country, both at its giant Pilbara iron ore mines – where the company owns its own generators – and in the east coast grid, where its aluminium smelters in Gladstone and Newcastle are some of the biggest power users.
Asked at its AGM whether the early closure of coal plants would add new threats to the viability of Rio’s smelters and other energy-intensive operations, Mr Stausholm said that he believed Australia should instead accelerate the introduction of renewable power into its energy mix. “It’s very clear – and it’s not just in Australia – we are just not developing renewable energy fast enough. That’s where we need to put our focus,” he said. Mr Stausholm said that as a major power user, Rio intended to play its part in building wind and solar power plants near its own operations.
