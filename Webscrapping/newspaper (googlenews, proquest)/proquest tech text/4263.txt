ANYONE keen for an enduring reminder of South Australia’s last dine-in Pizza Hut eatery can this week pick up a slice of local Adelaide restaurant history in an auction with the lot.
In the wake of the final pizzas being served up at the red-roofed Marion eatery, the contents of the once-popular family pizza place is going under the hammer on July 25.
Kilkenny auction house Mason Gray Strange is handling the sale, which ­includes a host of items sure to satisfy the appetite of people craving for a piece of history – or quality pizza-making equipment.
Auctioneer and valuer Andrew Maros said Pizza Hut exterior building signage could be a perfect addition to the shed or man cave, while other memorabilia up for grabs includes photographs, banners and a framed menu.
A gas twin-deck Middleby Marshall pizza oven, two Hobart dough mixers, a dish washer, a glass washer, an ice ­machine and a pasta cooker are among the pieces of speciality equipment under the hammer. Mr Maros said the oven could fetch bids of “close to $10,000”.
There are also hundreds of assorted pizza pans and lids, utensils, racking, restaurant tables, chairs, booth seating and point of sale registers for sale.
The auction will be at the premises at 489 Morphett Rd, Oaklands Park, at the Westfield Marion corner, at 11am on Monday, July 25, and webcast live at interbid.com.au/mgs. Inspection is available on site from 9am on the morning of the sale. Details: mgs.net.au or call ­Andrew Maros on 0418 845 884.
