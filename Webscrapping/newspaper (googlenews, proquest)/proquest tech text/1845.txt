GREEN ZONE -FUTURE ADELAIDE INITIATIVE ENGINEERS of the future will have to contend with more climate-change risks, so the University of Adelaide is offering a new course.
The new climate solutions major in the environmental engineering degree program has been approved by the university council for 2022.
The program already offers majors in renewable energy and smart technologies. Professor Holger Maier, who devised the new course, said it would train “the next generation of engineers to really address some of those challenges head on, really understand the issues and what the options are for finding some of the solutions to the problems”.
Climate solutions engineers might focus on urban water sources and systems, manage risk around heatwaves, bushfires and floods or consulting for financial, insurance and management companies modelling climate impacts.
Clare Flaherty, 21, of Prospect, jumped at the opportunity to transition into the new course.
She is currently taking subjects from arts, science and engineering to create her own double degree.
She is interested in ways to adapt infrastructure to reduce the impact on the environment and also cope with the challenges ahead, such as flooding, excessive heat and bushfires.
“With engineering, you can be more solution-focused (than with science),” Ms Flaherty said.
“That’s more optimistic, it gives you a bit more hope for the future.” clare.peddie@news.com.au
