AUSTRALIA’S triathlon world champion Mirinda Carfrae has found virtual reality competitions have unexpected hazards.
The triple world ironman champion was competing in the inaugural Ironman VR Pro Challenge when disaster struck.
Carfrae, right, was doing well on the 90km bike leg when she suffered a virtual mechanical failure.
Husband Tim O’Donnell tripped over the cord of her smart trainer, disconnecting it and putting her out of the race.
“He decided to bring my trophies in here as motivation and when he walked around the back he kicked out the plug. What an idiot,” Carfrae said. American Jocelyn McCauley won the race, which was shown live on Facebook.
