THE Best Practice Demonstration Farm field day at Struan on Wednesday gave all of industry an opportunity to find out more about AgTech and management solutions on-farm.
The Department of Primary Industries and Regions SA has collaborated with Elders in the development of the Best Practice Demonstration Farm. The Elders partnership is led by Thomas Elder Institute.
Attendees were privy to learning about suitable solutions and its value proposition for their operation or business.
Trade displays from AgriWebb, DIT Ag Tech, Farmbot, FarmLab, Goanna Ag and Pairtree, as well as many others, also offered producers a sneak peak into the possibilities of AgTech for their operation.
Stock Journal's VANESSA BINKS went along and captured some of the action.
