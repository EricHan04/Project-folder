Third time lucky proved true for the Goulburn High School Robotics team, with the side qualifying for the 2022 Vex Robotics World Championship.
The team travelled to Adelaide at the start of March to compete in the National VEXIQ Robotics Competition.
They competed in qualifying matches over two days and while they did not make the finals, they did win the design award.
Goulburn High qualified for the World Championship, which will run in May in Dallas, Texas, through an interview process.
The team was interviewed three times where they spoke about how they had constructed the robot, the problems they had faced and what they had done to solve these issues.
Goulburn High School Robotics teacher Katherine Hyland said the team did extremely well, not only in the interview process, but throughout the qualifying matches.
"Their documentation of all the problems that they've had with the robot was excellent and their interviewing was really good. The judges came up to me afterwards and told me that the students from Goulburn High School were a really cohesive team," Mrs Hyland said.
For each match, students had to use their robot to pick up balls placed around the field and shoot them into the high goal area which was a basket in the middle of the field.
There was also a low score area around that basket.
By the end of the match, each team also had to get its robot to either do a low hang chin up or high hang chin up depending on how many points they had.
