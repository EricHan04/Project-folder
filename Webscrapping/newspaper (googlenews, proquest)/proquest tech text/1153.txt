SA country footy export Justin Clarke’s sad story of premature retirement due to concussion has a heartwarming new chapter.
He is now a Rhodes Scholar.
Clarke, from Booleroo Centre-Melrose-Wilmington (BMW) in the Northern Areas League, played 56 AFL games for the Brisbane Lions before being forced into retirement in early 2016 due to ongoing issues with concussion. But he will graduate from the University of Queensland next month with a Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Science, before beginning studies with Oxford University, after earning Queensland’s sole scholarship position.
“After my football career ended on medical advice, I began studying aerospace engineering, a discipline I am passionate about and in which I want to make a difference,” Clarke told InQueensland. “Hypersonics is an area of active aerospace research which can radically change the way we travel around the world and improve access to space.” Clarke plans to complete a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science at Oxford’s Thermofluids Institute.
