SPACE to stretch, healthy food and on-board virtual reality zones are among the top desires for passengers on ultra-long flights, according to new research.
Exercise bikes and noise-cancelling headphones would also take the sting out of 17 hours flying, said travellers on the direct Perth to London route, which is one of the world’s longest commercial flights.
There was a strong demand for inclusions that contributed to “health and wellness”, according to the research, which was conducted by Qantas and Sydney University.
The airline is using the data to help shape the experience for flyers on its planned non-stop flights from Australia’s east coast to New York or London, expected in 2022.
The research was gathered by quizzing customers as soon as they landed about how their flight could be improved.
“Our job now is to determine where the most demand is and create this cabin in a way that makes it both affordable for customers and commercially viable for the airline,” said Qantas International CEO Alison Webster.
“Everything is on the table and we are excited about what innovations may come from this research.” The most requested in-flight offerings include separate zones for relaxing, exercising or using various forms of entertainment. Travellers are also looking for a variety of healthy foods and drinks, including herbal teas, juices and wine.
Industrial designer David Caon said the ideas were being considered in the design of the new ultra-long haul fleet.
“Customers are sharing some incredibly imaginative ideas, which is an exciting challenge and helps us to think outside of the box to redefine their flying experience over such long distances,” he said.“Bringing some of these concepts to life will involve an entire rethink around how to be clever about use of all cabin space and what is practically possible but it may well involve incorporating design elements never before seen on commercial aircraft.”
