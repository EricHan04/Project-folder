DEPARTMENT store David Jones is pushing high-interest credit cards onto shoppers with the promise of on-the-spot discounts, a selling tactic condemned by the banking royal commission.
The store’s retail workers are selling David Jones American Express credit cards to customers at the point of sale, offering discounts of up to 20 per cent for approved applications.
The cards incur a higher-than-average interest rate of 20.74 per cent and carry fees ranging from $99 to $295.
The royal commission recommended point-of-sale credit via retailers be abolished because it could not be assumed employees were truthfully recording customers’ financial positions.
Retailers are exempt from the laws and regulatory oversight that applies to banks and other financial institutions offering credit cards.
It is understood David Jones issues its cards through American Express’s credit licence, with all legal lending responsibility falling on the issuer rather than the retailer.
Consumer Action Law Centre policy director Katherine Temple said retail staff signed people up to credit cards with limited oversight or accountability.
“This means retail staff are often not properly trained on the products they are selling, or what’s required to comply with our credit laws,” she said. David Jones said it provided internal compliance training for staff in line with American Express lending standards.
