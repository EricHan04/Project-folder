THE state’s award-winning student robotics club is homeless, couch-surfing and shed-hopping while searching for a new base.
While South Australia was in lockdown, the RoboRoos from Student Robotics Club of SA competed in the Asia-Pacific Open Championship (via zoom) as part of the FIRST® LEGO League Challenge and won the robot design award.
Pauline, 12, in year 7 at Pembroke School, said it was “the hardest fun” you could ever have.
“It’s not quite Tokyo, but this is our STEM version of the Olympics,” she said. Abinav, 12, in year 7 at Sacred Heart College, said the team of nine students worked towards the goal all year with the support of volunteer mentors.
Club chairman Peter Ryan-Kane said: “We are currently homeless, after 10 years of building robots and winning international awards we are back to using people’s homes,” he said.
“We have become fragmented and we’re looking to consolidate back into new home.” On Saturday afternoon during National Science Week, RoboRoos are hosting a series of short, free “adults only” workshops at the Adelaide Showgrounds, to demystify coding and robotics for clueless parents and friends. Interactive robot driving is also on show, free. scienceweek.net.au
