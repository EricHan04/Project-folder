Tech-savvy students from the North East have battled for a spot in the VEX Robotics Nationals in Adelaide this December.
Groups from five schools used their hand-built robots to complete tasks at the North East and Southern Riverina championships.
The competition took place throughout Saturday at Galen Catholic College Wangaratta and year 12 student Rutvik Chaudhary helped co-ordinate the event.
"When we started in 2016, there weren't many teams around in Australia and there's now 60 EDR teams - the big robots - and 40 IQ teams - for middle school ages - and even regionally it's growing," he said.
The 18-year-old, who with his peers took part in the world championships in America this year and in 2018, said there were excellence awards up for grabs in Saturday's competition.
"They have to make a logbook when they build their robots detailing everything they've done - If I don't know anything about their robot, I should be able to get their logbook and build it," he said.
"That is judged and the next award is the tournament champions - the team on top for the whole competition go to the nationals."
The tasks set out for the students were released at the VEX World Championships in 2018.
For the older students competing in the EDR rounds, that included instructing their robots to maneuver cubes into elevated buckets.
Galen College and St Anne's Primary won excellence awards, while all other groups - Wangaratta Primary, Borinya School, Wodonga Middle Years College, and Albury Robotics Club, also won categories.
