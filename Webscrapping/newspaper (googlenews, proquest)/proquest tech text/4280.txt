The stand-alone ALDI on the corner of High St and Doonmore St closed its doors temporarily on Monday to undertake “comprehensive store upgrades” that will “make an even better shopping experience” for patrons.
The store is expected to reopen on March 3 with a new look including “better product displays, improved navigation, and modern styling” according to an ALDI Australia spokesperson.
“While we’re delighted to be introducing these innovations, we want our customers to know they won’t lead to higher prices,” the spokesperson said.
New features of the store will include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays and extended energy-efficient chillers.
There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
The works are part of ALDI’s statewide rollout of a more modern store design already popular in South Australia and Western Australia.
“We offer a supermarket experience that is like no other in Australia, and it’s our differences that allow us to bring unbeatable value to our customers every day,” an ALDI spokesperson said.
“We’re excited to be undertaking these upgrades and welcome the community to visit our new store once it opens to share their feedback.”
If you still need your ALDI fix while the High St store is closed, there are other supermarkets in Westfield, Glenmore Park, Cranebrook, Emu Plains, and St Marys.
