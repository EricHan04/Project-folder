Young film buffs on the Fleurieu are being sought to participate in a film festival taking place in Adelaide later this year.
Applications for the Youth Jury program as part of the Adelaide International Youth Film Festival are now open. The program is seeking youths aged between 15 and 25 living in regional South Australia, to join fellow jurors from Adelaide, interstate and overseas in viewing and judging the festival films to award prizes. There will be around 40 jurors in all.
The regional jurors are this year being sponsored by the Coca Cola Foundation.
Alongside screenings of films for young people aged five to 25, the festival will include hands-on workshops on elements of film making such as virtual reality and special effects makeup and Q&As with up and coming local filmmakers.
This year's festival runs from September 17 to 21, at Hoyts Cinemas in Norwood.
Youth Jury applications close on July 10. Visit www.aiyff.com.au/youth-jury/ to apply.
