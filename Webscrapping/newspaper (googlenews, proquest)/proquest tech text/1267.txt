WASHINGTON: A prototype of the future giant SpaceX rocket Starship – which the company hopes will be used for its Mars missions – crashed in a fiery explosion during a test launch along the Texas coast yesterday.
But the company’s response was upbeat as a livestream of the launch displayed the on-screen message “AWESOME TEST. CONGRATS STARSHIP TEAM!” “Mars, here we come!!” SpaceX founder and Tesla chief Elon Musk tweeted just minutes after the flight, explaining that the crash was simply caused by the landing speed being too fast.
He recounted the successful parts of the rocket’s short trip: the takeoff, the change of position in flight, and its (pre-explosion) precise landing trajectory.
“We got all the data we needed! Congrats SpaceX team,” he said. The rocket took off and ascended properly in a seemingly straight line, before one and then another of its engines went out as planned. After four minutes and 45 seconds of flight, its third engine extinguished and the rocket began its descent in its expected position.
The engines were restarted just seconds before landing in an effort to slow the ship, but it crashed hard into the ground.
Smaller prototypes have already blasted off several hundred metres into the air for less than a minute as part of a series of tests aimed at ­developing the next generation of rockets from the company at lightning speed.
After several aborted attempts this week, the flight was livestreamed on the @SpaceX Twitter account. The test flight was planned to check the huge metal body of SN8 (Starship No 8) and its three engines for their aerodynamics, including during the ship’s return to Earth which happens vertically, in the same vein as SpaceX’s pioneering Falcon 9 rocket.
