START-UP companies in agricultural technology, food and wine are being given a guiding hand with a new business incubator launched at the University of Adelaide’s Waite campus.
ThincLab Waite is the only incubator dedicated to start-ups in the agtech, food innovation and wine sectors in Adelaide. It joins the university’s stable of innovation hubs, which started with ThincLab Adelaide in July 2017.
The newly renovated space at the Waite campus gives ThincLab members access to office space and meeting rooms, and helps connect them with a network of industry mentors and coaches, investors and other organ-isations in the sector.
At Waite campus, the ThincLab start-ups are co-located with the largest concentration of expertise in the southern hemisphere in the areas of plant biotechnology, cereal breeding, sustainable agriculture, wine, horticulture and land management.“The South Australian agtech, food and wine sector is of crucial importance to our state but faces significant challenges that will require innovative solutions,” University of Adelaide Pro Vice-Chancellor, Entrepreneurship Professor Noel Lindsay said.
