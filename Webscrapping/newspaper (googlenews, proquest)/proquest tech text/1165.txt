REGAN Nelson was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, dysgraphia and cognitive processing memory disorder when he was in year 2.
Now the 15-year-old science buff wants to study aerospace engineering in the US when he finishes high school in South Australia.
Regan is an ambassador for SA’s biggest science competition, the Oliphant Science Awards, which are celebrating their 40th anniversary with record numbers.
The awards, named in honour of physicist and former South Australian governor Sir Mark Oliphant, have attracted 3090 entries from 107 schools this year.
Despite his disorders, Regan has entered the awards every year since he was a little boy and won prizes in the models and inventions category in 2018 and 2020.
“I do find writing a pain but I have learnt over the years how to play to my strengths and the Oliphants has really helped me discover this about myself,” said Regan, whose 2021 entry is called Engineering the Galaxy. “You don’t have to be the smartest or the fastest kid in the class to show your potential.”
