A South Australian start-up company has plans to launch rockets from the Eyre Peninsula Rockets could soon be lighting up the skies around Port Lincoln thanks to a new South Australian start-up initiative.
Southern Launch has taken up a lease of 1200ha of the freehold land at Whaler’s Way, 38km south of Port Lincoln, where it plans to develop a rocket launching facility capable of deploying multiple tiny satellites into polar orbit. The company hopes to complete the facility by the end of 2020.
There has been a sea change in the past few years in how satellites operate in terms of size, orbit, distance from Earth, longevity and cost. Big names like Amazon and Elon Musk’s SpaceX are putting serious money into creating webs of thousands of satellites orbiting in harmony.
“From a tech perspective, manufacturers are saying we’ll put up a satellite now knowing that in two years’ time, the technology will be obsolete and then we’ll put up another satellite. So there’s this business model of constantly needing to put up more and more satellites,” says Lloyd Damp, chief executive of Southern Launch. “It’ll be to establish the spiderweb or constellation of satellites and then regularly replenish the nodes.” Damp is working with SA interests such as the University of Adelaide on the plan, which is developing high-quality concrete that can endure the intense heat of a rocket blast, and Silentium Defence, a leader in radar.
It is too early to publish cost estimates but Damp expects to raise equity with relative ease.
“One of the fantastic things about building a space company is that, once you start to speak to people about what you’re trying to do, for the most part they want to get involved,” he says.
Southern Launch is in discussions with organisations around the world on using Whaler’s Way. Initially, components will be shipped in but in time the company will look at setting up a localassembly operation.
