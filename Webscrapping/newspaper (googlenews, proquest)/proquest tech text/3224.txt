KIMBA residents can get some more insight into the nuclear process with a virtual reality experience sharing an up-close view of how neutrons work.
As part of school holiday activities, the Kimba office will house a ANSTO virtual reality experience will show how neutrons work inside Australia's OPAL reactor, used to help produce nuclear medicine and assist industry.
The technology enables local communities to experience virtual reality through the superior Oculus headset.
There is also the opportunity to see inside the reactor floor and watch the staff at ANSTO working.
Department of Industry, Innovation and Science's Bruce Wilson said the technology would provide the communities of Kimba with insight into how tiny neutrons were put to work to benefit all Australians.
"This school holidays, kids, their families and others all have the opportunity to experience, firsthand nuclear science and cutting-edge research," he said.
"While the conversation is ongoing about the possible location of a National Radioactive Waste Management Facility, this technology will allow the community to view, in person, the front end of the nuclear cycle."
The virtual reality booth was open until December 21 and will reopen from January 6.
Interested community members can also download the free app 'ANSTO VR' from both the Apple App Store and on Google's Play Store to have the experience in 2D or 3D.
