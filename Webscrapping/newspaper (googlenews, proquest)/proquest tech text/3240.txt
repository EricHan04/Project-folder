DURING her final lap before Megxit, the Duchess of Sussex has shared a few behind-the-scenes photos of “private meetings” on their Instagram account.
The images show Meghan at London’s National Theatre, exploring their Immersive Storytelling Studio, a space which “works with artists and emerging technologies to develop new dramatic work and experiences”.
She wore a Topshop organza blouse paired with a Roland Mouret Moka skirt from the Resort 2020 collection for her “private” visit. She met with musician Nubiya Brandon and viewed her hologram, which is currently featured in an exhibit at the Tate Modern called All Kinds of Limbo, and is billed as “an immersive performance in virtual reality”.
“Yesterday, the Duchess of Sussex, Royal patron of the National Theatre, visited the Immersive Storytelling Studio in London, where emerging technology like virtual reality is being used to develop new forms of emotive storytelling,” reads the caption accompanying the photos.
“The goal of this method of virtual reality is to enable us to better connect and empathise with each other as people, regardless of race, age or nationality.”Several hours later, husband Prince Harry joined Britain’s Formula One world champion driver Lewis Hamilton, below, during a visit to officially open the Silverstone Experience museum at Silverstone motor racing circuit.
