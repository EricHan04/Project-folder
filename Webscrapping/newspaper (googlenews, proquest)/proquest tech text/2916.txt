JLL head of sales and investments Roger Klem said the property was within a major commercial hub and close to several major main road developments. “Properties of this calibre are increasingly held over multiple generations or, alternatively, locked away in syndicated vehicles for extended time periods,” he said.
“Given the stamp duty exemption in South Australia for commercial property transactions, the ability for investors to secure borrowings at record low interest rates and a long-term lease to an ASX-listed company, this property presents an exceptional opportunity to acquire a sound investment in a prime location.” The corner site offers on-site carparking for 34 vehicles and is close to the Firle Plaza shopping centre, the Glynde Hotel and retailers including Freedom Furniture, The Good Guys and Chemist King.
A proposed Bunnings store is planned for an adjacent site.
