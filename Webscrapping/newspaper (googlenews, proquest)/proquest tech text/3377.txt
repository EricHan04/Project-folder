FUTURE ship and submarine workers are set to be protected by exoskeletons, and helped by machining robots.
This week Flinders University announced it would work with Adelaide shipbuilders ASC on bringing the latest technology to Osborne.
Exoskeletons can be powered or unpowered.
They can protect and support the whole body, or just a hand. And they could be very useful when welding or grinding or doing heavy lifting.
Professor John Spoehr, from Flinders’ Australian Industrial Transformation Institute, said they would trial exoskeletons in shipbuilding to work out how to reduce heavy lifting and repetitive stress injuries.
“We would explore various risk postures, at factory and on board (such as the use of upper body exoskeletons for inverted welding), trial the impact on workers’ health and their level of acceptability,” he said. Another way to boost productivity and help workers is using machining robots.
Prof Spoehr said using robots in tricky spots could have “significant potential health and safety benefits”.
“The project will collect information about on-board and in-factory awkward postures, explore technological barriers and research and development needed and then trial machining robots in a number of use cases,” he said.
ASC Shipbuilding managing director Craig Lockhart said the shipyards of the future would also need autonomous ground delivery vehicles, paperless work orders, humans working with robots, virtual reality and a range of other technologies.
Lockheed Martin – the global defence giant – has developed exoskeletons for use in mining, aerospace, and heavy manufacturing.Lockheed is now working with Deakin University to improve the technology as well as finding way to make the exoskeleton lighter.
