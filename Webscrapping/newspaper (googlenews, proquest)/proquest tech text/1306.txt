A few months after Southern Launch's successful launch to the edge of space at the Koonibba Test Range, a local farmer discovered part of the rocket on his property.
Southern Launch visited Koonibba in September to usher in a new era of Australian space exploration. While the first launch misfired, there were two successful launches days later.
Farmer Jason Hammat was driving around his property when he made the discovery of the rocket.
"We were driving around to see which sheep had been attacked by a dog and we came across the rocket.
"It was about 500 metres from where they launched, on the east side of Foggos Road.
"We spoke with Corey [McLennan, Koonibba Community Aboriginal Corporation chief executive officer] and gave it back to him."
The rocket that was found was then handed back to Southern Launch by Mr McLennan.
Chief executive officer Lloyd Damp said Mr Hammat found part of the booster, which was to be displayed at the Australian Space Forum in Adelaide, which was called off due to COVID.
"We speak to farmers regularly and keep in contact with Corey. Jason passed it on to Corey and he gave it back to us," he said.
