Under the agreement Ark Energy, a subsidiary of Korea Zinc Co, will take a 30% stake in MacIntyre Wind Farm, with Acciona retaining 70%.
Acciona will remain responsible for managing the project through its development, construction, operations and maintenance stages.
Construction is slated to start in the second half of this year, with the lion’s share of investment in 2022 and 2023.
The wind farm complex will start operating in stages to ensure connection to the grid with full technical guarantees for the state electricity system.
The complex will be fully operational by 2024.
Acciona has secured a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with CleanCo, Queensland’s newest public electricity company, which will acquire the annual production from 400MW of Acciona’s facilities for ten years.
MacIntyre Wind Farm will also power Sun Metals Corporation, a Korea Zinc Co. subsidiary in Australia, helping the metals group meet its target of obtaining 100% of its energy from renewables by 2040.
In addition to the MacIntyre Wind Farm, Acciona will build the Karara Wind Farm (103MW), owned by CleanCo.
The wind farms are adjacent to each other.
Together, MacIntyre and Karara complex will generate clean electricity to supply nearly 700,000 homes and avoid the emission of around three million tonnes of CO2 each year.
The two projects will jointly mobilise investments of around $2b and will be key to the State of Queensland’s goal of achieving a 50% share of renewable energy in its electricity consumption by 2030.
The two projects will generate up to 400 jobs during throughout their useful lives and provide an important economic boost to the local community, with local investment exceeding $500m.
The wind farms will install 180 Nordex Delta 4000 5.7MW turbines, the latest generation of turbines by the German manufacturer.
