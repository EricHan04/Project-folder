CLEAN TECH FRENCH multinational Engie will invest $87m to build the first large-scale green hydrogen plant in the Pilbara.
The first phase of the Yuri project will produce up to 640 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year as a zero carbon feedback for an ammonia production facility in Karratha owned by Yara Australia.
Construction on the initial $87.1m Yuri project is expected to start in October and be operational in early 2024.
The project will produce green hydrogen via electrolysis from renewable energy and will have a 10MW electrolyser powered by an 18MW solar panels and supported by an 8MW battery energy storage system. Once commissioned it will be among the largest renewable energy-powered electrolysis setups in the world and significantly bigger than the largest electrolyser currently operating in Australia, a 1.25MW hydrogen plant in Adelaide’s Tonsley Park.
Yuri will be funded by a $47.5m grant from the federal government’s ARENA Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Fund and $2m from WA’s ­Renewable Hydrogen Fund.
Engie Australia and NZ chief executive Andrew Hyland said while the 10MW facility was large today, it was only a stepping stone to achieving enough scale to cater to the domestic and international markets. “The next stage will be between 10 and 20 times larger and ideally power a 100 to 200MW electrolyser and make up to 500 tonnes of hydrogen,” he said.
ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the Yuri project was an important step in Australian becoming a major exporter of renewable hydrogen. An agreement between Engie and Mitsui & Co has also been struck in which the latter will acquire a 28 per cent stake in the Yuri joint venture.
