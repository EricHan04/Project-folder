A HISTORIC satellite-tracking antenna that symbolises the Northern Territory’s role in the global space exploration era has been officially listed as a heritage object by the NT government.
Built in Belgium in 1966, the satellite tracking antenna was one of three parabolic dish antennae with an ‘XY’ tracking axis mount that were originally installed at the Gove Down Range Guidance and Telemetry Station at Gulkula on the Gove Peninsula, under a program led by the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO).
The antennae used state-of-the-art technology to help track the downrange path of rockets launched from Woomera in South Australia as they passed over the Northern Territory.
At the conclusion of the project in the early 1970s, the antennae were relocated to a defence facility near Adelaide until the Arnhem Land Historical Society began lobbying for the machinery to be returned to its original site. Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Chansey Paech said the ELDO’s satellite launch program was considered a spectacular and technically complex activity in Australia and particularly at the Gove Down Range Guidance and Telemetry Station. “This is a unique and fascinating part of our history which shows that the Northern Territory is, and has always been, a strategic location for space exploration,” he said.
