TILT Renewables Limited, owner of the Dundonnell wind farm and other wind energy assets in South Australia, has announced a number of buyers have expressed an interest in acquiring the company outright.
It follows a December decisions by its 65 per cent shareholder, Infratil Limited to put its share on the market.
AustralianSuper had expressed an interest in buying 100 per cent of Tilt Renewables at the time. But Infratil rejected selling its stake to AustralianSuper because, in part, it said it undervalued the renewable energy assets.
Tilt Renewables said last week it would give interested parties access to material to enable them to make binding bids.
“There is no certainty that Tilt Renewables will receive binding proposals or that any proposals received will be recommended to shareholders by the board,” the company said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange.
Infratil welcomed the interest in buying 100 per cent of Tilt Renewables. Infratil chief executive officer Marko Bogoievski said his company had received strong interest in Tilt since it ran its review process for its 65 per cent stake.
“This is the logical next step in what is a competitive process, reflecting the strong demand globally for high quality renewable platforms like Tilt,” Mr Bogoievski said. Tilt Renewables has built 80 wind turbines at Dundonnell, and operates wind farms at nearby Salt Creek, and in Snowtown in South Australia.
