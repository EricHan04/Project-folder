A WORLD-first, global three-race series of electric-powered “flying car” Grand Prix will kick off in a yet-to-be disclosed location later this year, after extensive testing in the South Australian outback.
The Airspeeder EXA Series will ­involve pilots controlling the Alauda Aeronautics Mk3 EXA race-craft at speeds of more than 190km/h. The races will take place on an “augmented reality” course. The companies behind it, Airspeeder and Alauda Aeronautics, were founded by Adelaide’s Matt Pearson, who is a founder of nanosatellite company Fleet Space Technologies.
