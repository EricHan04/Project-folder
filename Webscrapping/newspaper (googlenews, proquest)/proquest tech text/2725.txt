Mitcham council is seeking a strategic partner for the design, development and piloting of its community solar program, which guarantees no upfront costs and financial saving for ratepayers and renters.
The program aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity consumption by encouraging more households to go solar.
It will also aim to be competitive with existing solar providers and deals.
Mitcham Mayor Heather Holmes-Ross said the program formed part of the council’s ongoing push to increase the uptake of renewables within the community.
“While solar uptake has been quite successful in the City of Mitcham, with close to 40 per cent of properties with solar panels, we want to make solar accessible for all properties, including both residential and business landlords as well as tenants”, she said.
“Not only do we need a wider uptake of solar panels we also need to build a pathway for community energy storage and management by increasing battery storage capacity and reducing reliance on the grid.
“The community solar program will also be developed to support our local business community providing opportunities for indigenous businesses, innovative start-ups and local small businesses.”
Chief Entrepreneur for South Australia Andrew Nunn said the initiative was a great example of how councils could break the mould to encourage widespread adoption of future technologies.
“By inviting collaboration with industry partners, Mitcham is embarking on an innovative project to further accelerate the already strong rate in the uptake of renewable energy infrastructure in the region,” he said.
“I look forward to seeing the outcome, which is sure to save households and businesses money in the long-run.”
