South Australia punches above its weight in many areas, from the sporting arena to our world class vineyards. We’re also leading the charge on solar.
Worldwide, more solar energy is being added to our power grids than any other type of energy generation, making it a vital part of the push to phase out fossil fuels for good.
While China greatly outpaces the world in the number of gigawatt hours generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems each year, Australia lays claim to having more household solar panels per capita than any other nation, with more than 21 per cent of homes sporting rooftop solar systems.
In total, about 2.66 million systems had been installed across Australia by the end of 2020.
It’s in South Australia however, that the sun is really shining on solar generation.
At 12.05pm, on October 12 last year, our humble state pulled off a world-first when our rooftop and utility-scale solar network provided power for 100 per cent of total electricity needs.
As well as reinforcing the notion renewables are an entirely viable alternative to fossil fuels, it offered a glimpse into how the energy grid could look in the not too distant future. And while perfect weather conditions helped us achieve the milestone, it couldn’t have happened without the 300,000 plus South Australian households that have already installed solar in their homes.
How you can help SA continue to lead the way Faced with the challenge set by the State Government to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there’s still a way to go in eliminating non-renewable energy sources from the grid. And with the cost of traditional forms of electricity rising and the lifetime cost of solar systems coming down due to government subsidies and improved technologies, renewable energy is an increasingly attractive proposition.
It’s also an investment that, once paid for, is designed to save you money by generating free electricity. Add a home battery and you’ll also be safeguarding against blackouts and become more energy independent.
What’s the cost?
According to the Federal Government’s Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, a standard home solar system typically has a payback period of three to five years, which is extended by the inclusion of a battery. Whatever your plan, there are several payment options that can make your system more affordable and hassle-free.
RAA Solar and Battery Storage offers payment plans with no establishment fees or monthly charges* for all solar packages and will also help you make the most of available rebates and subsidies, including the State Government’s Home Battery Scheme. And to make things even more simple, RAA’s solar professionals can estimate your energy savings so you’ll know how long it’ll take before the system pays itself off.
