ROBOTS are coming alive at Prospect’s Blackfriars Priory School. Students are building hi-tech creations in their new $8.2m science, technology, engineering and maths centre, which has been completed in time for the start of this school year.
Named the Aquinas Centre, it features science and robotics laboratories, tutorial-style rooms, an open-plan “learning commons”, traditional classrooms and teacher work spaces for individual and group planning. It will be equipped for remote-learning options.
“The facilities, especially in the science and robotics labs, are amazing,” Year 12 student and school captain Lewis Saint said. “It feels more like a college campus than your average school building.” Junior school student Alex Galkowski, 7, said he liked the big TVs and all the robot equipment.
“It’s going to make my lessons interesting and fun,” he said. Fully financed by the school, it is the first major building development on the site for 40 years. “It’s a real step forward for the school,” principal Simon Cobiac said.
