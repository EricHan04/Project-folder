McAuley Community School at Hove opened in January last year for Reception to Year 6 students, offering a contemporary approach to learning.
It boasts Flexible Learning Neighbourhoods, which are designed to meet the needs of students as they collaborate on projects or work individually with their educator.
The school is committed to educational excellence and preparing students to take on the world of tomorrow. State-of-the-art facilities include green screens and dedicated makerspaces for STEM.
The curriculum design is shared with the students, creating a sense of ownership and passion for learning.
“At McAuley, we have adopted a whole school approach to our robotics program, building learners’ skills from Reception to Year 6,” teacher Yalinda Allen says.
Resources are carefully selected to progressively develop skill level in a range of robotic applications.
In Reception, Beebots are introduced, which is the initial stage of coding and can be integrated into numeracy and literacy through positional language.
In Years 1 and 2, Ozobots is added to the program, with students exploring location and position by designing maps and then coding the Beebots to get from one point to another.
The outcomes of the Robotics Program in Years 5 and 6 at McAuley include literate, numerate and effective communicators with a high level of inquisition and the ability to innovate.
Students have progressed to competency with 3D printers, advanced coding competency with Lego Spike and have developed the skills needed for technical measurement with Artie Drawing. Above all, students graduate from McAuley Community School with an inquiring mind and the skills to investigate.
