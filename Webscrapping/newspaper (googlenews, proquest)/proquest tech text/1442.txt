Japanese space officials are conducting a minor orbit tweak on a capsule due to touch down in the South Australian outback this weekend.
The Japanese space agency will "tweak" the trajectory for a capsule on track to land in the South Australian outback on Sunday.
The agency says it will perform a minor orbit correction on Tuesday, though the capsule, containing sub-surface asteroid samples, remains on course to land at a site in the Woomera prohibited area, in South Australia's north.
It says the correction will slightly alter the landing position to make work easier for its recovery team.
The capsule has been travelling onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft which first landed on the Ryugu asteroid, more than 300 million kilometres from earth, in February last year.
The spacecraft will return to orbit after depositing the capsule in a joint retrieval mission between Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the Australian Space Agency and the Department of Defence.
Scientists believe the samples may provide clues about the origins of life.
Asteroids are thought to have formed at the dawn of the solar system and Ryugu may contain organic matter that could have contributed to life on Earth.
Once back in orbit, Hayabusa2 will begin a second, 10-year mission to rendezvous in July 2031 with a much smaller asteroid known as 1998 KY26.
The Woomera prohibited area is currently used as a Defence test site.
Its connection to space exploration began in the 1950s and it hosted Australia's first satellite launch in 1967.
At its peak, it had the world's second-highest number of rocket launches after NASA's facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida.
