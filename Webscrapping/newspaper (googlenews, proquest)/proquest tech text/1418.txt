AUSTRALIAN businesses will reap a multibillion-dollar windfall from their work on the landmark mission to the moon and Mars, NASA bosses say.
The US space agency’s deputy administrator James W. Morhard also said an Australian astronaut could fly to the moon within five years. Mr Morhard said commerce and private ­industry help would be crucial to the project’s success and NASA’s deal with the Adelaide-based Australian Space Agency ­needed expertise in mining, ­including the finding of rare minerals, and proven cutting edge technologies.
Speaking at NASA’s HQ in Washington DC, Mr Morhard said international partners were critical to the success of President Donald Trump’s goal to get to the moon by 2024.
“It is our intent to create more commerce in space, which is going to provide great opportunities for the Australian space agency and the companies in Australia that are involved,” the NASA executive said. “So that is where I see it expanding.
“For us we have the same challenges, a lot of it is funding challenges. How do you do that? “Well, in (the) Apollo (moon mission) we owned and operated everything.
“We are looking to work with industry so we are basically (having) industries providing services to NASA so we can leverage their assets for the future of our space programs, which will make it a lot more affordable.” Asked if that was worth ­“billions of dollars to local businesses”, he replied: “Absolutely.”He raised the hope of further “deep space” exploration and would “look” at whether an Australian astronaut could be hired.
