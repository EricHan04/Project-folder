SCIENCE is everywhere at this year’s Fringe Festival, but Swedish magician Charlie Caper claims his show Robotricks is the most technically advanced of all.
Anyone who wishes to challenge that claim is welcome to approach the robot master and trade computer code.
Caper says he got really into robotics and started building for fun after experimenting with a robot six years ago for the show Minor Miracles.
“I’m getting old now, I’ve been a professional magician for 20 years and it’s easy for me to do good magic,” he said.
“I wanted to take the art form forward, push in a new direction and invent new tricks that don't exist and haven't been done before, rather than playing covers.” The audience can expect amazing magic and incredible robots along with thought-provoking analysis of society and the future, in a world full of artificial intelligence.
“I wanted to open up some lines of thought and tell people about things that are going to happen and things that might happen, how they might change the world,” Caper said.
“There are major changes coming and depending on how we deal with them we could be better off or find ourselves living in a dystopian society.” Inspiring South Australia program manager Dr Sheryn Pitman selected 33 shows for adults and eight for children to highlight this year. “Our Science at the Fringe guide is not just for science-buffs,” she said.
“It’s for anyone and everyone who likes to discover and learn amazing things about the world.
“We’ve compiled a concoction of the curious, amusing, fascinating and ingenious science-themed shows at this year’s Adelaide Fringe Festival.” You can download the Science at the Fringe Guide atinspiringsa.org.auSEE: CHARLIE CAPER – ROBTRICKS GLUTTONY – MASONIC LODGE – OWL ROOM, UNTIL MARCH 17
