ONE of the state’s biggest home builders is planning further investment in a new state-of-the-art virtual reality studio, which could revolutionise the way builders showcase their designs.
Opened by Rivergum Homes in December, Plan Lab allows customers to walk through a life-size floorplan projected on to the floor, with movable furniture and wall sections available to create spaces within the design.
Housing facades can also be projected onto a wall of the 370sq m facility, providing customers with a full picture of their chosen design.
Rivergum Homes managing director Victor Said said the studio could be used to display designs for detached homes, apartments and commercial projects, with a number of developers, architects and building groups already using the technology for their projects.
“For us it’s about giving the consumer the opportunity to receive a level of service that they require for such a big investment,” he said.
“It allows us to provide an alternative - we can say quite clearly that we have 200 homes on display in one spot.
“We’re also looking to enhance the facility as far as it allows us to be more visual with furniture, changing colours - it’s about investing to enhance the experience.” Plan Lab is open for private consultations and is free for Rivergum customers. Mr Said said the studio had also been presented to developers, architects, interior designers, boutique builders and project marketers who had shown an interest in the new capability.
He said it was the first step in a major change to the way Rivergum engages with its customers. “One of our plans moving forward is for clients to be able to see their houses as they’re being built - we’ll fly some drones over and they’ll be able to see their home being built through certain stages.”
