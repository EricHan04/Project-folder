STUDENTS from Rostrevor College and Glenelg Primary were among young South Australians at nearly 40 schools who watched the launch of wattle seeds into space on the SpaceX Falcon rocket yesterday.
The seeds will spend six months in orbit, then be sent to the schools for planting.
Rostrevor Year 5 student Marcus said the students were eager to see what effect the space trip would have on the plants.
“It is good to have young people like us involved because we are interested in seeing what happens to the seeds and because we will be here in future years to keep the project going,” he said.
“We already know that astronauts who have been in space for a long time need to exercise to stop their bones getting weak, so perhaps something like that could happen to the seeds and affect their growth in some way.” The SpaceX Falcon Dragon rocket ship launched from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.
The Space Wattles program is a joint initiative of the Australian Space Agency, Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and NASA.
The One Giant Leap Foundation in Australia selected schools to participate in the project.
The foundation will send the schools 12 seeds each – six that have been to space and six that have not – to grow and compare. “It’s one small step for a kid, one giant leap for the wattle,” said Glenelg Year 3 student Lorcan.
