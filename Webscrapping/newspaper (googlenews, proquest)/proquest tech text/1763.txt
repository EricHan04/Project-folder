South East primary producers are among the state's small core showing strong interest in technology to help shape the future of farming, a survey reveals.
It is in contrast with more than 50 per cent of primary producers who are not currently investing in on-farm technology, SA government's AgTech Advisory group explained.
The recent figure was pulled from their first survey, which received more than 600 responses from primary producers, agricultural advisors, researchers, and AgTech suppliers.
However, the group highlights "important progress" with the establishment of AgTech demonstration sites in Struan and Kybybolite in the South East.
For now, the results will play an important role in the final AgTech Strategic Plan.
The advisory board said how feedback demonstrated the need for a collaborative and cohesive approach to encouraging greater adoption of technology on-farm in SA.
Of concern was that the survey found 18 per cent of farmers are not planning on investing in technology in the future.
The state government, meanwhile, views AgTech as a key to greatly enhancing the productivity, profitability and sustainability of the agricultural sectors.
It will work with the agricultural community to see the value in AgTech, support its development and assist the adoption of solutions on-farm for beneficial outcomes.
The results of the survey will be used to formulate South Australia's AgTech Strategic Plan which is due for release this year.
