AVOCA SHOPPERS will be able to check out the new Aldi Avoca building this week. The Aldi Avoca store on the corner of Johnston and Bolewski Sts will close permanently from 8pm on Tuesday.
The new store will then open at 8.30am on Wednesday at 123 Takalvan St, Avoca. The News-Mail understands many of the improvements in the new store were implemented following extensive store trials and Aldi’s statewide rollout of its modern store design in South Australia and Western Australia.
“While we’re delighted to be introducing these innovations at our new store, we want our customers to know they won’t lead to higher prices,” an Aldi Australia representative said.
“Low prices are a big deal for Aldi.” The features in the new store include redesigned shelving, expanded produce bays, as well as extended energy efficient chillers and energy efficient LED lighting.
There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage. The new Aldi Avoca will continue to be supported by a team of 20–25 permanent full and part-time employees.
