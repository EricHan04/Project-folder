ELON Musk challenged the friend of a friend who accused him of sexual assault to describe scars or tattoos of his allegedly “exposed” body parts previously unknown to the public.
A day after he declared he would vote Republican, the world’s richest man was ­accused of propositioning a flight attendant for sex in ­exchange for a horse.
“But I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me ‘exposed’,” Musk said in a tweet. “Describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never ­happened.” News outlet Insider reported that Musk’s rocket company SpaceX paid a woman $250,000 in 2018 to settle a misconduct claim against him. The report alleged Musk exposed his erect penis to her, touched her leg without consent, and asked her to perform a sex act during a private jet flight to London. Citing interviews and ­documents, Insider said the attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX’s corporate jet fleet.
