THE only Australian manufacturer of photovoltaic panels, Tindo Solar at Mawson Lakes, has moved into a new $11m factory.
Tindo, which has been operating from an adjacent site, will be able to double its output.
“We employ an excellent workforce that has always pushed for innovation and quality in an Australian-made product, and we’ll be continuing that tradition,” chief executive Shayne Jaenisch said. Tindo has made more than 284,000 solar panels since it was founded in 2011.
