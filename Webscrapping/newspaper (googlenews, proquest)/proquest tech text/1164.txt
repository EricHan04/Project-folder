AN aerospace engineering start-up will partner with the University of Sydney to research and manufacture the components of a zero emissions, hypersonic spaceplane – a launch vehicle capable of deploying small satellites into low Earth orbit.
Named Delta Velos, the vehicle will be powered by four green hydrogen-fuelled scramjet engines, enabling carbon neutral propulsion. It will also include the world’s first 3D printed fixed geometry (no moving parts) scramjet engine in Australia, completed under the Australian commercialisation grant awarded to Hypersonix Launch Systems in August 2020. Using next generation additive manufacturing technology, University of Sydney researchers will develop flight-critical components, further versions of the scramjet engine (testing several material components) and vehicle fuselage at the university’s Sydney manufacturing hub. “Additive manufacturing is making the previously impossible, possible,” research team leader Professor Simon Ringer said.
