CYCLING enthusiasts will be pumped up and ready to roll towards a bargain as the remaining stock at Warradale business Bernie Jones Cycles goes under the hammer.
Evans Clarke National is handling the sale of the equipment and assets of the Diagonal Rd firm, which shut late last month after more than 50 years of trading.
Bidding is now open at biddingonline.com.au for the 182-lot auction, which features a huge range of quality bicycle parts including wheels, rims, frames, handlebars, seat posts, brakes, tubes, pedals, shoes and Lycra. Tools and hardware used for bicycle repairs and maintenance are also expected to be highly sought after.
Evans Clarke national business development manager Ben Schwidder said with all items unreserved, cyclists had “a rare opportunity to pick up high-quality bicycle parts from a trusted business at a fraction of the retail price”.
“This type of equipment new doesn’t come in the auction market often,” Mr Schwidder said. “Anyone interested in cycling should have a look through the catalogue and take advantage of this opportunity.
“The auction also suits other bike shops and resellers as well as individuals who are looking to upgrade or replace parts on their bicycle.” As well as bicycle equipment, the sale will also have plenty of retail equipment go under the hammer, including shop display stands, a reception counter, point-of-sale systems and security sensor gates.
The online auction will close on Tuesday at 7pm. Items can be inspected on site at 239 Diagonal Rd, Warradale, on Monday from 3pm to 4pm. To view the catalogue and place a bid head to biddingonline.com.au and search for sale number 39554.For more information contact Ben Schwidder on 8345 0099
