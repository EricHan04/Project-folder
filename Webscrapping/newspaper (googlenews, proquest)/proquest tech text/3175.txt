More about the event highlightsNASA oceanographer asks what is the sound of colour? - online
What would colour sound like? What does the world under the icecaps look like?
NASA Oceanographer Ryan Vandermeulen takes satellite data from space-borne sensors that detect the colour variations in the oceans.
The human eye and brain seamlessly detect and translate different wavelengths of colour into images. Â 
Ryan was intrigued by the idea of capturing and isolating the individual components of colour data, and instead of interpreting them into a picture, thranslating these variations into an aural experience. What would colour sound like?
Ryan shows how converting satellite data into music reveals natural harmonies in ocean colour optical signatures in â€˜The Sound of Colourâ€™.

Moving images: virtual reality helps us accept death â€“ Carlton, VIC
Guided meditation in virtual reality could comfort the dying in their final moments.
Psychology scientist Dr Nicholas Van Dam will talk to artist Efterpi Soropos about using virtual reality to improve people's moods, even in the saddest circumstances.
Efterpi has been creating art in palliative care, transforming bleak patient rooms with light, sound and video.
Can guided meditations in virtual nature environments affect our mood and emotions? Can a virtual environment help soothe those in palliative care? And can it ever compare to meditating on the side of a mountain or deep in a forest? Ask the experts.

A band of physicists go on a road trip to explain quantum and dark matter â€“ Bendigo today; Stawell tomorrow
Dark matter accounts for 85 per cent of all the matter in the Universeâ€¦ but we donâ€™t yet know what it is. Australia is a key player in the quest to find out.
Quantum technologies are crucial in the hunt for dark matter, and theyâ€™re already used in smart phones and cars, medical imaging, manufacturing, and navigation. But todayâ€™s technologies capture only a small fraction of the potential of quantum physics.
The National Quantum & Dark Matter Road Trip brings quantum and dark matter experts to cities and towns around Australia, travelling from Brisbane to Perth via Coffs Harbour, Sydney, Canberra, Bendigo, Stawell, Adelaide, Kalgoorlie and many more towns in between. This follows a successful tour of southern WA in National Science Week last year.

Multiple experts involved with different legs of the tour are available for media interviews, including dark matter enlightener Jackie Bondell and UWA particle physicist Ben McAllister.
Dinosaurs, furry friends, Aussie orchids, and a T-Rex autopsy show: all on the Sydney Science Trail â€“ Sydney
See rare orchids, learn about First Nations medicine, and meet scientists from the Australian Institute of Botanical Science at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney.
Ask about climate change solutions, hear about First Nations tools and technologies from the experts, meet a furry possum, and come face-to-face with the roving puppet dinosaur Winny the Muttaburrasaurus at Australian Museum.
The Sydney Science Trail is back in multiple locations across the city, with family-friendly activities, an expo, workshops, expert talks, silly science, and spectacular demonstrations.
Education program: Monday 15 - Friday 19 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/sydney-science-trail-education/sydney

How do you engage a broader or younger audience with the science of cancer and the need to reduce the risk of developing the disease?
The â€˜Cancer ARt Galleryâ€™ is a new cancer-biology-themed art gallery overlaid with augmented reality (AR), adaptive soundtracks and videography. It presents a series of AR artworks using pop-culture and nostalgic themes to explain cancer biology. Itâ€™s the brainchild of Dr Ken Dutton-Regester, a cancer researcher at QIMR Berghofer and founder of creative studio Excite Science.
Each artwork is the result of a collaboration between a cancer researcher and an artist, mutually exploring creative expression to form an immersive and memorable experience.
Saturday 13 - Sunday 21 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/print-and-host-your-own-cancer-themed-augmented-reality-art-gallery

Meteorites, sea creatures, bush tucker, and carp wars: science stories projected onto landmark buildings â€“ Regional SA
â€˜Constellationâ€™ takes audiences on a tour of regional South Australia to see five science stories as large-scale projections onto five iconic landmarks.
Port Pirie Constellation at City Park uncovers the secret depths and abundant species of the Spencer Gulf.Quorn Constellation at the silo goes on a bush tucker trail to arid lands, gorges, and peaks, exploring the evolution of edible and useful plants that can survive in extreme conditions.Wallaroo Constellation at the silo explores the history and future of copper, the third most consumed industrial metal in the world, pivotal to industrialisation in South Australia.Karoonda Constellation at the silo reveals the story of the Karoonda meteorite as told through the eyes of a local mallee fowl.Barmera Constellation at the Bonney Theatre tells the story of Lake Bonney and the carp wars through the eyes of a Murray cod.



These science-art-community collaborations show how each regionâ€™s challenges and future were shaped by science and innovation. The landmarks star as a constellation of science-informed storytelling.
Nightly projects throughout the month of August.
Companion events on multiple dates and locations.
