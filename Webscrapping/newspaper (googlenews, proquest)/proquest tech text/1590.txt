Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham has announced an initial $2.4 million in state government funding across three years to achieve the objectives of the inaugural SA AgTech Strategic Plan.
"This is an exciting time, for the first time in SA we have a collaborative and cohesive blueprint for the agtech sector," Mr Basham said.
State-government led initiatives will include the opening of agtech demonstration farms at government research sites in Nuriootpa, Turretfield, Minnipa and Port Lincoln, and will also help to establish agtech startup hubs in the South East and on the Eyre Peninsula.
Agtech extension officers will also be appointed across the state, including independent Intermediaries and agtech ambassadors, to act as trusted advisers for producers.
"The Marshall Liberal government firmly believes that supporting innovation and advancement in the field of agtech is essential to increase the productivity, growth and sustainability of primary industry sectors in SA," Mr Basham said.
"I look forward to the success this plan will bring for SA agtech industries."
