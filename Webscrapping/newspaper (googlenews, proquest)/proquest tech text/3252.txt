AS the largest open-access visual arts festival in the world, SALA – the South Australian Living Artists Festival – is all about seeing the bigger picture.
Through the eyes, skills and imagination of more than 8000 participating artists, we are able to view an ever-changing social and physical landscape, presented in an innovative mix of media.
This takes both traditional forms – such as paint, sculpture, photography and print – and exciting new mediums including digitally generated imagery, video and now, even virtual reality.
Artists are using the latest materials and emerging technologies to produce exciting works that speak to a 21st century community.
For example, those who aren’t lucky enough to be able to visit the Venice Biennale exhibition in Italy will be able to still experience James Darling and Lesley Forwood’s massive installation Living Rocks, presented by the Art Gallery in The Chapel at Lot Fourteen – the former RAH site.
Using immersive virtual reality technology created by local company Jumpgate, visitors will be able to see the duo’s 30m-wide reflection pool – complete with three tonnes of mallee roots, moving video screens and soundtrack by the Australian String Quartet – as if they were standing in Venice.
It is among almost 700 exhibitions and events in this year’s SALA Festival program, ranging from shows by established artists to those who are trying their hand for the first time.
Just as diverse as the works themselves are the types of venues in which they are displayed, from cafes and medical research centres to theatre foyers, railway museums and bars.
The Advertiser is proud to have been associated with SALA as the event’s major sponsor for more than a decade and to support the state’s visual artists.
Make the most of the month of August to immerse yourself in the kaleidoscope of experiences that is SALA, discover new venues and meet the local artists behind the images.Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Matt Deighton, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, SA ,5000
