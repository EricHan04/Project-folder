CALL TO ARMS CHILDREN nervous about needles now have a chance to “escape” their trauma. Instead of watching in trepidation as the nurse approaches with a vaccine syringe, they can plunge into a serene scene of seals frolicking underwater.
The Women’s and Children’s Hospital is giving young patients virtual reality goggles to take their mind off receiving the Covid-19 jab.
Charlie Atkinson, 14, was nervous about receiving his second injection, so immunisation nurse Madeleine reassured him and then provided a pair of virtual reality goggles.
The teenager received his vaccine while watching the seals, saying it was a much easier experience the second time around.
“I don’t like getting any kind of vaccination and when Madeleine said to me ‘This will be quick’, I said ‘Oh, no it won’t,” Charlie said.
“The goggles were so cool. I watched seals swimming underwater and I wasn’t thinking about the vaccine because I couldn’t see it.
“It was really helpful and I think everyone should come and get their vaccine at the hospital.” Madeleine said when Charlie arrived for his first shot, the process took about 30 minutes because of his fear of needles.
“So, I thought I’d try the VR goggles and they worked so well,” she said. The hospital is encouraging families of eligible children who are anxious about the shot to book in their vaccine at the clinic. The offer is not just for children: adults with trypanophobia, a fear of needles, can also book in and request the goggles.
