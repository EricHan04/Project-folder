THE world’s second-richest man, Jeff Bezos, has announced that he will step down as the boss of Amazon.
Mr Bezos said yesterday he would be handing over the reins of the company he transformed from an online bookstore to a global tech behemoth.
Mr Bezos, who founded Amazon in 1994, will transition to executive chairman of the company’s board.
Amazon Web Services boss Andy Jassy becomes Amazon’s new chief executive in the third quarter of this year. Mr Bezos announced his decision as Amazon’s quarterly sales rocketed past $US100bn ($131bn) for the first time, cementing its place as a $US2.23bn market juggernaut.
The departure will allow Mr Bezos to spend time on some of his many side projects, including space-exploration company Blue Origin – which is going head to head with Elon Musk’s SpaceX – as well as his charities, and his newspaper, The Washington Post. The executive leaves a legacy as one of the most influential tech and business minds of his time.
