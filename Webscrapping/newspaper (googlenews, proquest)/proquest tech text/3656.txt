GIN lovers can now raise a glass to Kangaroo Island’s bushfire recovery knowing they are helping the cause.
Renmark’s Twenty Third Street Distillery has made a limited-edition Bushfire Recovery Signature Gin.
With its launch coming six months after KI’s devastating bushfires, 100 per cent of its sales are being donated to SAVEM (SA Veterinary Emergency Manage­ment) towards wildlife recovery and long-term rehabilitation.
The gin’s label has been designed by KI artist Janine Mackintosh whose works are inspired by native plants on her bush property.
“The piece is comprised of KI narrow-leafed eucalyptus leaves and the little dots are the flower caps,” Mackintosh said.
The artwork was like an aerial landscape “with the spaces like wallaby tracks, and the flower caps could be seen as the animals darting through the bush,” she said.
The bottle also has an augmented reality feature: when the label is scanned using a mobile phone app, a video plays to show the catastrophic effects of the bushfires on KI.
Keely Valente, 26, and Lukas Bubenas, 25, were among the first to taste the gin at 23rd On Melbourne. “It’s great to be able to enjoy a South Australian gin while supporting a very worthy cause,” Ms Valente said.
The gin is available from Twenty Third Street Distillery in Renmark, 23rd On Melbourne in North Adelaide and from sippify.com.au P23: ADELAIDE CONFIDENTIAL
