The Marshall government has pledged an extra $15 million to progress Trafigura's $750 million Port Pirie Hydrogen Project and has written to the federal government seeking a contribution.
The latest funding is on top of $2.5 million previously committed to help pay for the plant's Front End Engineering Design and will speed the investment and jobs boom this project is expected to deliver to Port Pirie.
Trafigura is an international commodity trader that owns Nyrstar smelter where the world-leading plant will be built.
It will produce green hydrogen and ammonia and is described as cementing South Australia as a world leader in the export of renewable energy. Deputy Premier and Stuart candidate Dan van Holst Pellekaan said the project would be a once-in-a-generation investment to bring more jobs and greater opportunity to the people of Port Pirie and the Upper Spencer Gulf.
"The government is investing in transforming South Australia's energy system and in the process generating well-paid jobs around the Upper Spencer Gulf and North," he said.
General manager of Trafigura Australia Tim Rogers said his company welcomed the funding.
"Additional support from the government is critical to the final investment decision and this commitment brings the project one step closer to being built," he said. Smelter chief Dale Webb, who is vice-president of Nyrstar Australia, said the project would create hundreds of jobs in construction and support the next generation of workers at the Port Pirie plant as the world transitioned to a greener economy.
The funding comes from within existing departmental resources.
