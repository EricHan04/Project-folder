Soaring coal prices are driving up power costs in NSW and Queensland as Victoria and South Australia reap the benefits of relying on brown coal and renewables rather than black coal, undercutting scare campaigns about "wrecking ball" economic losses from clean energy.
The states that burn the most black coal and use the least renewable energy, NSW and Queensland, have the highest wholesale power prices and worst future outlook while Victoria and SA have been shielded from the spikes.
In the first quarter of the year, NSW's wholesale price was $87 a megawatt hour, up 129 per cent from $38 a MWh this time last year. In Queensland, the wholesale price hit $150, up 248 per cent from $43, exacerbated by an outage at the Callide coal plant. Black coal prices have spiked because Russia's invasion of Ukraine created increased demand for coal.
Experts including Grattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood and Schneider Electric's Lisa Zembrodt have said the wholesale price hikes will flow onto retail bills.
During the 2019 election campaign the Coalition attacked Labor leader Bill Shorten when he pledged to lift the share of renewable energy to 50 per cent of the energy grid. In this campaign, Taylor said power prices will rise up to $560 because bill payers would bear the cost of Labor's grid upgrades. Labor has pledged to invest $20 billion into electricity transmission lines, which would attract $58 billion in private investment. Mike Foley
