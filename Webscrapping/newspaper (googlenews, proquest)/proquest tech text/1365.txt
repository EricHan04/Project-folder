SpaceXâ€™s swanky new crew capsule has made an old-fashioned splashdown in the Atlantic, ending a six-day test flight to the International Space Station.
The Dragon capsule pulled away from the orbiting lab yesterday. Six hours later, the capsule, carrying a test dummy, parachuted into the ocean several hundred kilometres off the Florida coast. NASA televised the descent with footage coming from a plane. SpaceX employees at its headquarters near Los Angeles went wild when the splashdown occurred on time and the capsule was seen floating upright.It was the first time in 50 years that a capsule designed for astronauts landed in the Atlantic.
