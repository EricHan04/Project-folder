A NEW program aims to break down barriers and attract more diverse developers into the state’s gaming sector.
Adelaide Economic Development Agency is partnering with Pirie-street based Game Plus to create a support program for people not typically represented in the gaming world.
This includes women, people of Aboriginal heritage, and LGBTQIA+ communities. “With the help of AEDA, Game Plus will connect members of the program with the people, resources, and opportunities they need to truly prosper,” Game Plus team leader Jarrod Farquhar-Nicol said.
The Game Plus support program is open to early career practitioners, as well as people interested in visual effects, screen, virtual reality and graphic design.
Successful applicants receive a place in the Game Plus co-working space, marketing support and industry guidance.
Game Plus member Katie Abela looks forward to welcoming more gamers through the program.
“Game Plus has provided my team and I with a great working space to develop our games and even release our first game, Frontier Quest, as well as allowed us to meet some great people who work in the industry,” she said.
