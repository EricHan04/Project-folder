THIS year's GRDC Grains Research Update in Adelaide is being held at the Covention Centre next Tuesday, February 12, and Wednesday, February 13.
With the theme of Boosting profitability - resilient solutions, this popular event will be attended by agronomists, consultants, researchers, growers and other grains industry personnel.
Global market competition; managing diseases and weeds in intensive cropping systems; tips for early-sown winter wheats; treating soil acidification; the expansion of pulses; and research towards predicting diamondback moth risk in canola will be among topics of concurrent sessions on day one.
Other day one topics include amelioration of sandy soils; factors that drive nitrogen availability in cereal crops; National Variety Trials results; sustaining herbicides; the likely threat of mice in 2019; and robotics for broadacre farming.
Agronomic topics to be covered on day two include fungicide strategies in canola; integrated weed management; herbicide residues in soils; root diseases in pulses and cereals; key lessons in stubble management; in-field assessment of crop nitrogen levels; and the role of nitrogen as a possible tool to lessen the impact of heat stress in wheat.
The seedbank life of emerging problem weeds will be another topic of considerable interest on day two, along with tactics for increased profitability in the high rainfall zone; an overview of five years of canola agronomic research; the impact of chaff lining on weed seeds; minimising the risk of extreme temperatures in critical pulse development windows; and getting the best from barley.
