This year's National Poll Dorset Conference will focus on how to develop and implement breeding programs, the importance of setting key breeding objectives, and how this drives producers to achieve their goals.
The Central Western NSW region of the Australian Poll Dorset Association will host the biennial conference from March 17 to 19 in Orange, NSW.
Central West region secretary Ruth Klingner said the event was a great opportunity for breeders to learn from the speakers and each other.
"All breeders should be looking towards the future, see what is coming, and utilising it," Ms Klingner said.
"While we shouldn't forget about the things we know now and the traditional things we have done right, we need to be using future technologies and looking at impending markets to keep progressing the breed."
Topics will include marketing stud stock, the latest research on mastitis, campylobacter, brucellosis, arthritis and summer pneumonia, DNA testing, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, Meat Standards Australia and its future, eating quality, lamb survival, heat stress in sheep, terminal sire 2039 - what does it look like, and technology now and into the future.
The event features an impressive line-up of Australian and international speakers.
"The committee has aimed to provide a program that informs and educates attendees on things that they can apply to their business on-farm right now, as well as in to the future," Ms Klingner said.
On the third day of the conference there will be first-hand demonstrations on electronic tags, Gudair vaccinating without getting lumps and drones and robotics in sheep farming.
Despite the drought, Ms Klingner said that there had been a good number of registrations to-date from nearly all states of Australia.
