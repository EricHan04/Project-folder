Port Lincoln High School is showcasing the artistic talents of its students with an art exhibition at the Nautilus Arts Centre to coincide with a dance production.
The 'Beautiful Illusions' art and design exhibition is now on display in the centre's Rotary Gallery, coinciding with the school's dance production, also called 'Beautiful Illusions', which will feature at the Nautilus Theatre this Friday at 7pm.
A total of 87 students between years 8 and 11 contributed or collaborated on works on display in the exhibition.
Visual arts teacher Annette Kelson said the exhibition, together with the dance production served as a celebration of the arts at the high school as the visual, design and performing arts were featured together.
"It's indicative of 'Beautiful Illusions', whatever (the students) put on a two dimensional plane is an illusion, just like with dance how movement creates illusions and forms," she said.
Among the works on display are design projects created by students out of the school's new STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) facility using some of the new technology available.
Some of the works from the school's Aboriginal Arts Program will later go to Adelaide for the Our Young Mob exhibition.
Arts program manager Jenny Silver said the staff who hung the work were surprised with the variety of works on display.
She said the Nautilus Arts Centre staff helped get the exhibition ready and the centre had continued to be very accommodating.
Tickets for the dance production are available at the high school and the Nautilus Arts Centre.
