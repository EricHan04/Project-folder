THE state government has launched Japanese and Korean language websites as part of its $593m Hydrogen Jobs Plan.
Featuring information about the plan and for potential investors and developers, the websites are hydrogen.sa.gov.au/jpn and hydrogen.sa.gov.au/kor.
They have been launched to coincide with Premier Peter Malinauskas’s trade mission to Japan and Korea to promote South Australia’s push to become a world leader in renewable energy.
The Hydrogen Jobs Plan’s new hydrogen facility in Whyalla is expected to be in operation by the end of 2025. Mr Malinauskas will also speak at the Australian Japanese Business Council Conference in Japan about moving towards a carbon neutral world.
