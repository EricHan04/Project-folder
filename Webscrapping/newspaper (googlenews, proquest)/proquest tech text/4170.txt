SECURING a pay rise is getting harder for many workers as wage growth continues to stagnate but there are still ways to land a six-figure job. Change Meridian founder Michelle Gibbings says there are industries in which pay rates are traditionally higher, while shifting roles may also pay off.
“While many six-figure salaries require a university degree, there are still plenty of options that don’t,” she says.
“Construction managers, air traffic controllers and crane operators earn good salaries with no degree required, as well as people in sales and those working in the mining sector.
“Bear in mind, for many of these roles, certification or accreditation is necessary and so learning and training is important.” Jobseekers also should get to know the jobs market and the industries that are looking for workers now.
“There’s a skills shortage in IT, cyber security, automotive and engineering trades and construction sectors,” Gibbings says.
“If you take IT for example, where there’s one of the biggest shortfalls, you don’t always need a degree to get your foot in the door.
“Be prepared to start at entry level, such as working on a help/support desk or in a tech call centre and work your way up.
“Remember, the daily rate for contractors is usually higher than for permanent employees.” Workers also can be early adopters and become skilled in emerging jobs in which few people are qualified.
“The future is bright for roles that are based on or extended by the use of current, new and emerging technologies,” she says.
“This includes, for example, roles such as data analysts, software and applications developers, social media experts, AI and machine learning, big data, process automation and robotics engineers.” Keep in mind the increasing need for emotional skills.“It is expected, for example, there will be further growth in roles such as customer service, sales and marketing, learning and development, organisational development, and innovation,” she says.
