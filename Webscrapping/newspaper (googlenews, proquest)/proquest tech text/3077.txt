UNDERWATER legend Jacques Cousteau once said “the best way to observe a fish is to become a fish”, and that’s what South Australians are being urged to do this summer.
Experiencing Marine Sanctuaries – or EMS – is a guided snorkelling tour program that aims to introduce people to the underwater wonders of the South Australian coastline.
From the crystal-clear waters of Piccaninnie Ponds to the marine life wonderland of Noarlunga Reef, the tours are all led by nationally accredited dive instructors and will often have student and qualified marine biologists in the group. Program manager, dive enthusiast and underwater photographer Carl Charter said EMS has been running for six years and in that time the program had taken about 6000 people snorkelling.
“Down in the South-East, Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, all across the Adelaide coast, we go everywhere,” Mr Charter said. “We aim at young families or anyone who doesn’t have the confidence to go out on their own. We supply all the equipment, trained staff, all the safety equipment you need.” Mr Charter said people with a disability are also welcome to sign up for a class, with beach wheelchairs, extra flotation and modified wetsuits available.
“We’ve taken people from five years old to 85 years old,” he said. “And if you really can’t get into the water, then we can take you on a 15-minute virtual reality dive to show what it’s like to see something like our leafy sea dragons at the Rapid Bay Jetty, for example.” Mr Charter said that while people often thought of places like the Great Barrier Reef when thinking of underwater attractions, South Australia’s reefs were actually more diverse.
“We have a lot of things that are endemic to South Australia that you can’t find anywhere else in the world,” he said.
“We’re very lucky to have such a biodiversity of plants and animals.” FOR MORE INFORMATION OR TO BOOK A TOUR WITH EMS GO TO WWW.EMSAU.ORG
