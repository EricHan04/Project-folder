♦ Anzac360 films are emotional, immersive virtual reality short movies for a phone, tablet or headset.
♦ The experience makes viewers feel as if they are right at the heart of the story and location, from World War II Thailand and Borneo to the Western Front battlefields of France and Belgium.
♦ Drone footage “flies” viewers over the landscape while on-ground cameras give a gritty up-close perspective.
♦ Narration, sound effects, graphics and overlaid period video and photos introduce real characters and events.
♦ First-time users are advised to use their device like a “magic window” that shows the view wherever they point it. The experience is best on wi-fi.♦ Get the free Anzac360 app at the Apple store, Google Play store or on your Occulus headset or check out a trial clip on Facebook at AnzacLive.
