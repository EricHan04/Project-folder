TECHNOLOGY is helping beef consumers gain an understanding of where their food comes from.
At the Alice Springs Show, NT, the NT Cattlemen's Association paired with Meat & Livestock Australia, and its subsidiary Good Meat, to display a virtual reality tour of the entire beef supply chain.
NTCA business development officer Rohan Leach said the goal was to educate the general community about where their food comes from.
"It gives a paddock to plate experience of the different practices along the beef supply chain," he said.
The tour starts on a farm in Qld, before moving to a feedlot, saleyards, and even an abattoir, giving a 360 degree view throughout the 6.5 minute video.
"The final scene is a restaurant in Brisbane," Mr Leach said. "People are finding it helpful to learn where it all comes from.
"Kids especially love it."
He said there had been a steady stream of people through the stand.
MLA red meat advocate Anna Kelly said the VR tour had already been to Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney shows, as well as a number of schools, universities and farmers' markets.

"We get some amazing feedback, especially in the city where there is a disconnect," she said.
"People still do think food appears magically in the supermarket."
Ms Kelly said she often had people approach her months after going on the VR tour.
"Because the technology is so amazing and the message is so strong, it has a long-lasting effect," she said.
