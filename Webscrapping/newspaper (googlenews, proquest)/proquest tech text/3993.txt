JOBS in artificial intelligence, robotics and spycraft will be on the table as billions of defence dollars flow into South Australia.
A panel of experts will this week tell young people how to break into an industry with opportunities that go far beyond the shipyard. Building the ships and submarines of the future in Adelaide will demand plenty of engineers, project managers, and tradies. But the growing industry will also need interior designers, psychologists, human resources experts, and other jobs people may not associate with defence.
And that’s before taking into account the new space industry. The industry’s biggest challenge is about the workforce of the future, about finding the best and brightest for these big new projects.
To that end, The Advertiser is hosting the Future Proof Defence Jobs Program at the University of Adelaide on Thursday. Major industry players along with the universities will set out what is on offer for school students – who have to make their SATAC choices ahead of the looming September 30 deadline – and uni students looking for new opportunities.
