A GOLD Coast space exploration company has teamed up with another trailblazer — South Australia’s Fleet Space Technologies — to launch six satellites into orbit.
Gilmour Space Technologies chief executive Adam Gilmour said the contract to launch six Fleet Space Centauri nanosatellites on its Eris rockets in 2023 was a “great example of how Australian space companies are scaling and partnering to compete in the global space market”.
Gilmour Space and Fleet Space were the first two Australian space start-ups to raise venture capital funding in Australia.
Formed before the Australian Space Agency, the companies were seeded by Sydney-based venture capital firm Blackbird Ventures.
Fleet Space chief executive Flavia Tata Nardini said the launch would involve an Australian-built payload in an Australian-built satellite on an Australian-built rocket.
The announcement followed the release of the federal government’s Modern Manufacturing Strategy and Space National Manufacturing Priority Roadmap. It seeks to develop sovereign capabilities in space manufacturing, including satellites and launch vehicles.
