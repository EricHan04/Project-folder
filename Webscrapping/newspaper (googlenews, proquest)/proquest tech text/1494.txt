There was plenty of positivity about the future of Australia's agricultural industry as established professionals and students came together for the sixth annual Growing the Future.
Organised by the Adelaide University Agricultural Students Union, the dinner at the Adelaide Oval was described as a "careers night with a difference" by AUASA president James Easter.
The crowd was made up by representatives of some of the big - and small - industry players, as well as school and tertiary students interested in an career within the ag sector.
As well as networking, the evening also included a panel that discussed what the future of the industry is going to look like and the importance of agtech.
Stock Journal's ELIZABETH ANDERSON went along to the evening.
