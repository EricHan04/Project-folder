WINDOW DRESSING GETS SERIOUSLY SMART With so many advancements in home automation systems and “smart” products, it’s now easy to incorporate smart window treatments to add a touch of everyday luxury, functionality, and privacy to a home. The hi-tech features of the latest automated shades and curtains can help control your room’s temperature, lighting and overall home security.
There’s a range of internal and external window dressing products that can be controlled from a central hub, in which a smartphone or tablet can operate, set scenes and schedules — that your shades and curtains will remember – and even operate remotely when away from home.
They also offer intelligent home support for digital assistants such as Amazon, Alexa and Google Assistant, which means they can be operated with voice commands. Better still, this style of window dressing is becoming increasingly affordable and, done right, you could even come out ahead. “Installing the right window coverings, such as Luxaflex Duette Architella shades, can reduce your heating costs by up to 43 per cent,” says Vera Meharg, marketing manager of Luxaflex Window Fashions.
