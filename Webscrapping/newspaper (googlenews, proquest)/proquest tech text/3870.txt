WESTMINSTER students with a passion for fashion, are psyched for psychology or have enthusiasm for engineering have been given a $16m boost.
The Marion school’s new innovation hub centre includes laboratories, workshops, an industrial-scale kitchen and flexible learning spaces in a three-storey building.
The hub also includes robotics and engineering equipment, an industry-standard laser cutter/printer, a specialised fashion design space with 25 industrial sewing machines and sophisticated physics, chemistry, psychology and biology spaces.
“In a state committed to the evolution of new technology and industry, it is vital that students are ready to make a meaningful contribution in South Australia and be positioned to extend this across the nation and globe,” principal Simon Shepherd said.
“We’re focused on preparing kids for life beyond school, developing the whole person as well as their cognitive capacity.” The hub is one of four components in a $38m first stage of a masterplan to redevelop the Uniting Church school’s campus.
A sports pavilion overlooking the playing fields was recently completed. Work is now under way on a new wing, the Carter Studios, which will house creative arts and digital media studios and a three-storey cultural hub with extended drama and music facilities.
The fourth major construction element will be a 250-seat dining space and a cafe.
Westminster council chair Phillip Styles said key academic staff had identified areas of growth which then shaped the investment decisions.
“We want students to achieve more than they thought possible,” he said. Year 8 science student Sophie said it was “great to be able to do even more experiments”. Fellow Year 8 Angus said the laboratory was flooded with natural light. In hospitality, Year 8 student Tami said: “The food tech room is spacious and modern. The facilities are really good to cook in – it’s like an actual kitchen.”
