VICTORIA Police are trialling a virtual reality training system that puts officers in simulated life-or-death situations.
They have been undergoing the training at the force’s academy. Officers don googles and replica guns before they are immersed in a virtual reality world similar to a video game.
They are then put through their paces in a variety of “dangerous” scenarios. Those includes an armed siege in a city venue where several people have been taken hostage.
Confronting a knife-wielding man in an apartment littered with extremist flags and literature is another.
Superintendent Ross Mc­Neill said the training scheme was a valuable tool. “The Americans use it a fair bit as do the UK police forces,” he said. “You can see how they (officers) will react in certain circumstances.”
