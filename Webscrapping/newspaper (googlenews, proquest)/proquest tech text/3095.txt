STUDENTS in South Australia are getting space fever.
St Andrew’s School in Walkerville is holding a space camp this week, giving students a glimpse into life beyond Earth.
They will simulate a weightless “moonwalk” by going scuba diving, learn coding, build a moon rover, experience virtual reality and end with a rocket launch.
Science teacher and qualified engineer Chris Boden and fellow teacher and marine biologist Daniel Hannigan are camp leaders.
The camp will “ignite students’ interests and enhance their learning”, Mr Boden said.
The students begin each day with fitness exercises before activities at the school, Space Discovery Centre at Lot Fourteen, Adelaide Scuba at Glenelg and The Planetarium on UniSA’s Mawson Lakes Campus.
Year 7 student Corbin Katz, 12, and year 3’s Victoria Staniszewski, 8, are on board the mission.
“One day I would like to have a career as an astronaut, an artist or a doctor,” Victoria said.
The camp is taking place as SA students compete to name the state’s own satellite being built by local company Inovor Technologies in partnership with Myriota. Entries are due by Friday. The winning name will be announced in September.
