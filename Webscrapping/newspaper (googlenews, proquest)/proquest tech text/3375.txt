The Advertiser’s Chief Arts Writer PATRICK McDONALD hands out gongs to some of the best and most unusual shows at this year’s Adelaide Festival and Fringe
BEST PUNCHLINE YOU COULD SEE COMING A MILE OFF, EVEN WITH ONE EYE Ulster American Dunstan Playhouse today, 4pm and 9.30pm and tomorrow, 5pm AFTER generally and genuinely shocking its audience into convulsions of laughter with one appalling, politically incorrect revelation after another, Ulster American still manages to get a huge guffaw with its piratical final line … even though its arrival has been clearly signalled for the previous 90 minutes.
BEST USE OF RECYCLING TO CREATE FLOATING FUN Foehn AC Arts Main Theatre, 11am, 2pm and 5pm today and tomorrow THE simplicity of this idea belies the complexity of its execution. After a hooded performer crafts shapes from shopping bags and sticky tape, a circle of electric fans surrounding the stage are turned on and off to create different currents of air upon which figures appear to dart and dance in an aerial ballet of exquisite beauty.
BEST FUSION OF CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY ART FORMS The Magic Flute Festival Theatre season ended WHILE UK group 1927’s visual aesthetic harks back to the silent film era, its use of digital projection technology to produce seamless interaction with the live opera performers in co-director Barry Kosky’s Berlin production created a world as magical as any virtual reality.
BEST MISCHIEVOUS FAMILY DANCE THEATRE Zizanie Space Theatre today 2pm and 7.30pm and tomorrow, 3.30pm ACCLAIMED choreographer Meryl Tankard’s creation for Restless Dance Theatre’s differently abled performers has a French title which can mean mischief or chaos and conjures an inventive, playful world, filled with animated video effects, to which children instantly respond.
BEST THING YOU CAN KEEP DOING AFTER THE FESTIVAL Quilty Art Gallery of SA until June 2JUST because the Festival officially ends tomorrow doesn’t mean your enjoyment of it has to. The first major career survey of Australian artist Ben Quilty’s work continues running at the Art Gallery – alongside art by his son in Joe’s World – until the start of June.
