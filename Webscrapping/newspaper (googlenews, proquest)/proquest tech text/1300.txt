US Consul General Michael Kleine says the latest Woomera space mission shows Australia and Japan are ideal partners for America in the quest to put the first woman and next man on the moon.
NASA co-operated with the Australian and Japanese space agencies to co-ordinate the December 6 landing of a capsule containing an asteroid sample at Woomera test range in the state’s Far North.
The Japanese Hayabusa2 spacecraft took samples from the asteroid Ryugu about 11.76 million kilometres from Earth. Mr Kleine said the mission was “the latest example of the groundbreaking space exploration and research that can only be accomplished by the closest of friends and allies”.
