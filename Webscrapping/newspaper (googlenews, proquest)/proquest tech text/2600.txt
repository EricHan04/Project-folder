A new $70 million hydrogen export hub is one key way the Commonwealth aims to grow a lucrative local industry that could create 8000 jobs and be worth $11 billion by 2050, the minister will say in a speech in Sydney today.
Tasmania is aiming to secure the hub at Bell Bay in the state’s North, but is competing with six other locations around Australia.
Tasmania in race for $70m hydrogen export hub
Talking Point: World watching as Tasmania kickstarts clean hydrogen industry
“A regional hydrogen export hub will allow us to create jobs, build larger and more efficient supply chains, and provide a focal point for workforce skills,” Mr Taylor will say.
But getting to a point where industry can produce the new fuel source at under $2 a kilogram “will be where the rubber meets the road”.
“It is only by achieving the efficiencies that come with scale that we will get costs down in the sector, making hydrogen competitive,” Mr Taylor will say.
“Projects will require significant capital inflows, vast amounts of land, a hydrogen-ready workforce and large amounts of water.”
It will require “considerable effort” by industry and governments in the next decade.
A competitive grants process will be held to pick the location as early as next year, but the federal government will first launch grants for studies to investigate international markets and supply chains.
Tasmania aims to become a major exporter of hydrogen industry, with the state government outlining its strategy to develop the sector earlier this year.
The state’s abundant water and renewable energy resources will give it an edge in competing with other states.
Gladstone in Queensland, Western Australia’s north west, Darwin, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the Spencer Gulf in South Australia are also in the running for the hub.
