No need to drive to the garden centre. You’re in it STAFF WRITERS
Servicing your car could soon involve some pruning and dynamic lifter — at least if Audi’s idea takes off. The German maker has incorporated a miniature greenhouse in its latest concept, the AI:ME city car, while also fitting a pergola to the roof.
Audi says the real plants used inside the futuristic AI:ME, revealed at the Shanghai motor show, improve the ambience and freshen the air, two important elements when navigating the concrete jungle for which the all-electric hatch has been designed.
“Vegetation, which is rarely found in the hostile city environment, gives occupants a feeling of proximity to nature,” the Audi hype says, “and helps to objectively improve air quality in the automobile at the same time.” Audi claims to have fitted the mobile greenhouse with “sophisticated filter technology” that excludes unwanted odours and polluted city air. The electro-chromatic glass roof blocks heat and light and, for good measure, decorative “filigree wooden struts in the roof area create a pergola above the interior”.
Of course, the AI:ME does without an internal combustion engine, instead relying on a its 125kW electric motor to drive the rear wheels. It’s fed by a 65kWh battery that should comfortably provide hundreds of kilometres of range.
The AI:ME has level four autonomous functionality, allowing full hands-off driving in various conditions. It is designed to drive more smoothly than most humans, in turn improving wellbeing for up to four occupants.Tech includes a 3D monitor for driver’s eye tracking, virtual reality goggles for the infotainment and noise-cancelling that’s claimed to completely block outside noise.
