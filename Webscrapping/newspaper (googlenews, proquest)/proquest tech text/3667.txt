A NEW mural is not only the biggest in the city centre, running the length of a side street, but appears to come to life as you wander by with your smartphone.
The artwork on the walls of St Aloysius’ College in Chancery Lane has been a two-year project.
But it’s not just big. Downloading the EyeJack app, and holding your device up to each of the four main images of students and the Empowering Bright Futures title, unlocks a series of augmented reality videos.
In the section symbolising growth, student Celeste Owens, 11, is depicted tending to a potted plant. In the related video she appears like an animated giant, towering over cars parked along the street as she puts on a glove, plants a seed and waters it in.
The project began with an exhibition of hundreds of images submitted by students, staff and parents that they felt showed the school’s values.
A small group of students from Years 7 to 12 then drove the project, working for months with Riggs Digital to finalise the design and film the animations, plus behind-the-scenes footage.Students also had a hand in painting the mural alongside professional artists.
