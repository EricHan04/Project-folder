Member for Frome Geoff Brock MP is urging regional sporting organisations to reapply for the next round of infrastructure funding.
"Many sports benefited from the program last financial year, including an application from the Port Pirie Council who won $255,000 to construct a cricket pitch, nets and all-access toilet amenities at the Senate Road Complex," Mr Brock said.
"This new round of funding is set to continue to reinvigorate community sports after dealing with the impacts of the pandemic and I encourage applications to this worthwhile grant suite which includes the Regional and Districts Facilities Program, Grassroots Facilities Program and the Community Recreation and Sport Facilities Program.
"I encourage clubs and organisations to consider applying for this funding and I am happy to support applications in the Frome electorate."
The most recent round of $24.3 million was allocated to more than 100 different projects across South Australia.
Projects can range from upgrading changerooms and lighting infrastructure, updating sporting surfaces, installation of solar panels and other smart technologies, improving active recreation trails and installing specialised sporting infrastructure.
Councils and sporting organisations can find out more about the grants and apply for funding at www.orsr.sa.gov.au/funding/apply_for_funding
State Government funding previously went towards the Port Pirie Sports Precinct.
