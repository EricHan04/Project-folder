AUSTRALIA and India are uniting to drive innovation across their grain industries.
Innovators from the two countries have been invited to bring new ideas and climate-smart solutions to grain growers in the inaugural Graft Aus-India AgTech Challenge.
The challenge aims to help technologists, start-ups, and companies to drive innovation into the rain-fed grains industries. It will test, validate and scale out-of-the-box solutions to the shared challenges of climate change.
Birchip Cropping Group chief executive Chris Sounness said many farmers had already successfully adapted to farming in a changing climate, but the sector would need to keep innovating to “remain climate-resilient into the future”.
“While Australian growers are making the most of developments in farming technology and largely closing the yield gap, Australia’s $18 billion-dollar grains sector has experienced a drop in yield potential since the 1990s, due largely to the effects of climate change,” he said.
Graft program manager William Taing said India was a natural partner. “India not only faces challenges adapting to climate change, but importantly, the Indian start-up ecosystem is tenacious, and makes things happen even in the most difficult situations,” he said.
Grains Research & Development Corporation’s business development and commercialisation manager Fernando Felquer said Australia’s grain production could only benefit from the collaboration with India’s start-up community.
Twelve start-ups – six from each country – will be selected to take part in a 10-day in-country program to localise their product for either the Indian or Australian market.Details: graftchallenge.com
