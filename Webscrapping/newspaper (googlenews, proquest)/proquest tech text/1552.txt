THE state government is establishing a number of new AgTech demonstration sites in SA and is calling for submissions of suitable products to showcase.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham said new sites at the Minnipa Agricultural Centre, and Nuriootpa and Turretfield research farms, would help show the value of technology to farmers and producers in those regions.
"We're inviting suppliers of innovative agricultural technologies, known as AgTech, to tell us about their products, and let us know what difference they can make for SA producers," he said.
"It could end up being demonstrated to our primary producers, helping to de-risk their investment in relevant technologies by showcasing how it can improve efficiencies and increase their outputs."
Anyone with a commercially-available AgTech product is encouraged to contact the government.
