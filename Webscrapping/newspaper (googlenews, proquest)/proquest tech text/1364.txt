PREMIER Steven Marshall and Industry and Skills Minister David Pisoni charged taxpayers more than $4600 for luxury chauffeured vehicles to whisk them around Los Angeles during the G’Day USA trade mission in January, credit card statements reveal.
Credit-card statements obtained by the Opposition via Freedom of Information show Mr Marshall spent $2517.72 on Avalon Transportation cars while Mr Pisoni paid $2146.20 to the hire car company while in LA for just a few days.
During the trip, Mr Marshall met several companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Warner Bros, Disney, Netflix, 20th Century Fox, Sony Studios and General Atomics.
Labor spokesman Blai Boyer labelled the transport bill “extravagant” and said it was “further proof” the Government had its priorities wrong.
A Government spokesman said the cars were used to transport Mr Marshall and a group of people, including (SA’s) Chief Entrepreneur.
He said the full details of the trip would be disclosed online when they were available.“The trade mission was focused on increasing South Australian exports to the United States, which is already our second largest export market, and attracting investment,” he said.
