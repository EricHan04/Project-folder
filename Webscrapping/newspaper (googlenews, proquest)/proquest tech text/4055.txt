Port Augusta Secondary School's state of the art STEM Centre has been recognised for its innovation and ingenuity on a national scale.
The $2.5 million STEM mecca won the New Individual Facility Under $8 million category at the 2019 Learning Environment SA and NT Awards.
The project was praised for encapsulating the qualities of 21st Century education; ingenuity, innovation, resourcefulness and improvisation, in a rural school setting.
Thomson Rossi were the architects commissioned to build the centre which was officially opened earlier this year.
They said: "with structure and services exposed and with raw finishes, the building becomes a machine for learning, whose exposed workings aim to inspire the creation of STEM project work and facilitate the process of making."
The centre is equipped with ultra modern technology, including robotics and laser printers.
It also boasts a brand new $1 million visual arts pod where a central area with tiered seating allows for casual and formal learning opportunities and potential interaction between the two learning streams.
The open teaching environments are accompanied by smaller thinking, making and testing study spaces for individual, small group or collaborative learning.
Member for Stuart Dan van Holst Pellekaan praised the centre during its official opening.
"This (STEM centre) is incredibly important at two levels. We know that 75 per cent of all future jobs will include science, technology, engineering and maths, but we also know a lot of those jobs are in our region," he said.
"We are not training students here at PASS to go and get jobs at other places, we are actually training people for jobs that will be in the north of South Australia for decades to come and that's a very very positive factor."
The facility beat out five other new constructions from South Australia and Northern Territory to claim the award.
