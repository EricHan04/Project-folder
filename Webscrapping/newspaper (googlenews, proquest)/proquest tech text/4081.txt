US online behemoth Amazon is building the nation’s largest roboticised warehouse as it steps up its assault on the nation’s retail sector.
Amazon has begun work on a massive robotics fulfilment centre, which will house 11 million different products across floor space spanning 10 Melbourne Cricket Grounds.
The 200,000sq m centre is part of a revolution across the retail sector with Coles and Woolworths also starting to use robots in their warehouses to supply stores and pack and pick online orders.
Amazon Australia operations director Craig Fuller said the four-level warehouse was one of the nation’s largest “shovel-ready” projects as it deals with the coronavirus crisis.
“The Amazon Robotics fulfilment centre will more than double our operational footprint in Australia, enhance efficiency and safety for our associates while ultimately providing customers with wider selection and faster delivery,” Mr Fuller said.
The state-of-the-art warehouse is being built in the western Sydney suburb of Oakdale West. Amazon plans to open it in late 2021. About 1500 people are expected to work at the warehouse alongside advanced robots, while another 700 jobs will be created during the construction phase. Mr Fuller said the use of robots would help Amazon deliver a smarter, faster and more consistent experience for customers, adding the online retail pioneer may seek out more large-scale sites for additional robotic facilities. Amazon launched its retail offer in Australia in December 2017 and operates three smaller manual warehouses in Melbourne, Sydney and at Perth Airport. A fourth fulfilment centre, a 25,000sq m facility, will begin operating in Brisbane this year. THE AUSTRALIAN
