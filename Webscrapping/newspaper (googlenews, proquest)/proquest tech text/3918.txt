ROBOTS will help people clear rubbish from polluted water worldwide, students say. Westminster School year 7 students have designed robots to do the dirty work and tested the prototypes in the school’s pool.
Anna, 12 said she initially felt “really sad and overwhelmed” to learn about the global problem of plastic pollution but it was good to explore solutions, and her prototype “performed really well”. It worked a bit like a V-shaped broom, sweeping the water’s surface and scooping up bottles before driving them back to the person collecting the rubbish.
“Robots can be more efficient, faster, and can go further into the water,” she said. “There are things humans can’t do that robots can do, to help us with our environmental problems.” The prototypes were made using simple “found” materials, powered and manoeuvred by a Sphero robot. Students also wrote the code to program the robot’s activity. Coding and robotics teacher Ross Willoughby said the students were able to develop “computational and creative thinking” through a connection to the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development.
Aijay, 12 enjoyed learning, while “having fun doing it”. “The whole idea was to understand what was really going on and how we can change it,” she said. “So then, when we grow up, the whole world isn’t going to be filled with rubbish.”
