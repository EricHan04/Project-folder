St Patrick’s Technical College opened its doors to local primary school Catherine McAuley to provide students with real hands-on experience in skilled pathways.
The Year 7 students started building their robotics skills thanks to St Patrick’s Technical College’s Information Technology (IT) students.
The Year 12 IT class ran a six-week robotics program for the primary school students.
The senior students are studying a Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and Technology concurrently with their SACE and have been mentored by major tech companies such as Saab Australia, DXC Technology and BAE Systems Australia.
The class also won the inaugural VEX Robotics Championships for South Australia and competed at nationals in November last year.
St Patrick’s Technical College’s STEM faculty manager Brad Sheridan said the students were excited to pass their knowledge onto other students.
He said the Year 7 Catherine McAuley students learnt basic assembly and programming skills.
“This kind of program where students mentor students are fantastic for all involved. It gives the younger students exposure to digital technologies which will play a prevalent role in their futures and it also gives the older students valuable workplace skills, such as communication and leadership,’’ Mr Sheridan said.
Catherine McAuley Year 7 teacher Nicholas Guidolin said the program was his students’ first foray into robotics.
“We are now looking at a big push in digital technologies and a program like this helps our students with their skills but also with potential career pathways they may want to pursue,’’ Mr Guidolin said.
The College hosts several primary schools throughout the year and welcomes other schools who would like to give their students some hands-on learning opportunities.For more information on our programs and VET for secondary schooling, contact St Patrick’s Technical College on 8209 3700 or visit the website stpatstech.sa.edu.au
