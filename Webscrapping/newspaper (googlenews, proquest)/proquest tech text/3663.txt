APPLE has launched an iPad Pro and a faster MacBook Air â€“ even though almost all of its stores are shut worldwide.
It means that keen shoppers will have to buy the new products online before actually seeing them in person.
Both products introduce never-before-seen features, including extra cameras, augmented-reality hardware and radical keyboard revamps. Apple worldwide marketing senior vice-president Phil Schiller announced the new products in tweets yesterday.The latest iPad features an extra wide-angle camera and a scanner that makes virtual objects appear in real-world locations. Apple has closed all of its stores outside of China until further notice.
