AUDITS of 31 licensed e-cigarette and vaping retailers in Adelaide have registered no serious breaches of new packaging and advertising laws.
In March 2019, the e-cigarette industry in South Australia became more regulated. Advertising and point-of-sale displays were restricted.
After the laws came into effect, SA Health compliance officers visited all the registered retailers to ensure they were obeying the new laws.Health Protection and Licensing Services executive director Dr Chris Lease said there had been no expiation orders issued during the audits.
