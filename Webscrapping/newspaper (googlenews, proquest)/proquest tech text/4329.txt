ALDI Ararat will close for two weeks in late April while it undergoes a comprehensive refurbishment.
The store will close its doors from 3pm April 28 and reopen on May 11.
The refurbishment will include redesigned shelving, expanded wooden produce bays, as well as extended energy-efficient chillers.
There will also be improved point-of-sale displays and store signage.
The refurbishment has been implemented in store trials across Victoria, and has already been rolled out in South Australia and Western Australia.
An ALDI Australia spokeswoman said the upgrades would not alter product pricing.
"Low prices are a big deal for ALDI. In fact, we refuse to be beaten on price. This is our fundamental point of difference and one we will never give away," she said.
"We're excited to be undertaking these upgrades and welcome the community to visit our new store from Saturday 11th of May, and share their feedback about the store experience."
While ALDI Ararat is closed, shoppers can visit ALDI Alfredton located at 1611-1613 Sturt Street, or ALDI Horsham located at 67-73 Hamilton Street..
ALDI Ararat will continue to maintain a team of 15-20 permanent full and part-time employees.
Hours of operation will not be affected outside of the refurbishment dates.
