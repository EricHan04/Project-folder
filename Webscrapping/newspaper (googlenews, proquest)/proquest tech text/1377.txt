TOP End shipping company Sea Swift and the Gumatj Corporation have teamed up to restore a piece of Australian space exploration history to its rightful home in Nhulunbuy.
The European Launcher Development Organisation space exploration guidance antenna operated at the East Arnhem Land site between 1967 and 1970 before being relocated to Adelaide’s Edinburgh defence base.
Now, thanks to the efforts of the Arnhemland Historical Society and with the help of Sea Swift and Gumatj, the antenna is back where it belongs.
The society’s Maria Robbins said the project to bring the antenna home served as a reminder about the technical innovation and achievements of the 1960s in the context of space exploration.
“In the late 1960s, the geographical location of Gulkula and the Gove Peninsula and its existing land and port infrastructure, made Gove an ideal site for building a rocket tracking station,” she said. “The antenna being back close to its original location confirms the uniqueness of the land, its geographical location and features and how it supported ambitious, unique research and science projects aiming at betterment of humanity.”
