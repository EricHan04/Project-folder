FOR Adelaide-based business Impressive Advertising, this year has been about diversifying their focus from media, creative and production to technology established in Silicon Valley.
The company has spent the past six years developing an augmented reality app, “Oodl”, which allows users to scan images such as street art and find out about the artist and other information.
However, Impressive Advertising managing director Trevor Worley, pictured, said the first COVID-19 lockdown saw his team look at how the app could assist local businesses.
“We came up with the idea of non-contact menus, restaurants would have a display card in the middle of the table and Oodl reads that image, taking you through to a menu on your phone,” he said.
Unlike QR code technology, Mr Worley said Oodl allows clients to curate what they wanted customers to see, meaning they could easily incorporate promotions alongside their daily menu.
“The Pancake Kitchen started straight away, they’re already on board,” he said. “People are delighted by it, they don’t want to pick up laminated menus and still today we see paper menus that have been handled by plenty of people.” While it remains a creative agency at its core, the business’s shift towards modern technology has opened many new exciting avenues. “As a result of lockdown we now have three certified drone operators,” Mr Worley said. “We have also helped roll out a new client initiative, The Courier app, that’s based on the Uber concept – but in the delivery business – and we’ll be rolling it out Australia-wide. We’re also working on augmented reality concepts and publications; we’re continually reinventing ourselves.”
