The South Australian Drought Resilience Adoption and Innovation Hub, which includes a node at Minnipa, is being expanded following an injection of federal government funding, while the state government has announced a new AgTech start-up hub will open in the Eyre Peninsula town.
Additional funding has been announced for the SA Drought Hub, based at the University of Adelaide's Roseworthy campus, which will be utilised to undertake broader innovation activities.
An extra $20 million in funding has been announced for eight hubs across the country to grow agricultural innovation, drive commercialisation and create jobs.
There are five hub nodes located across the state, at Minnipa, Port Augusta, Orroroo, Loxton and Struan.
The hub's interim director, University of Adelaide professor Chris Preston, welcomed the funding announcement.
"The extra funding and broadening of the SA Drought Hub's scope is an endorsement by the [federal government] of the importance of our hub and its pivotal role in delivering research innovations to strengthen the resilience of farmers and regional communities," he said.
Meanwhile, the new AgTech hub, part of the state government's $7.6 million AgTech program, will utilise the Minnipa Agricultural Centre and Farm as a focal point for development and commercialisation of AgTech that supports broadacre cropping and sheep production systems.
Primary Industries Minister David Basham said increased AgTech adoption would be a "boon for the whole state" with farmers growing more food, leading to greater profitability.
"AgTech - which can include sensors, farm management software, imagery, smart farm equipment and genomics - enables agribusiness to innovate, grow and adopt more efficient practices," he said.
"The new start-up hubs will specifically support entrepreneurs in developing innovative technology capabilities, so they can help farmers solve critical agricultural industry challenges."
