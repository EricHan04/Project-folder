UNLEY Council and start-up Adelaide firm Forestree have developed an app that measures and monitors the local l tree canopy.
Users can search residential addresses to see how the tree canopy on their property and surrounding neighbourhood has changed between 2018 and 2021.
The analysis has been done with the help of global aerial-mapping company Aerometrex.
Mayor Michael Hewitson, pictured, said measuring a city’s tree cover was “previously a laborious process that often took months to compile, with a high degree of inaccuracy”.
“The simple fact is we are a small city with minimal public land on which council can plant more trees to address losses,” he said.
“We needed to educate our residents by giving them highly accurate data and urging them to look after the trees that we have, and to consider planting more.” The tree canopy data can be accessed at mycanop­y.unley.sa.gov.au
