A BUILDER has predicted that a new wave of home designs incorporating drone-landing pads could hit the property market in as little as three years.
While it may sound like the plot of a Ken Saunders book, it could in fact become a reality in just a few years.
In Saunders’ book 2028, people no longer deliver the post. Instead, drones deliver the mail and provide surveillance for ASIO.
Saunders put pen to paper in a comical way but builder Rivergum Homes’ design director John Eckert said the reality was that drone landing pads would become a viable option for new houses in the not-to-distant future.
“When I think of how online shopping has evolved in the last decade, it’s easy to see how this will affect the design of our homes to allow for a superior delivery experience,” he said.For drone operator Tony Gilbert, who specialises in aerial mapping, the future of drone delivery is not a joke. “I think that it’s a really great use of the technology, a logical use of the technology,” he said.
