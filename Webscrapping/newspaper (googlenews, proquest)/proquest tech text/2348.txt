SOARING numbers of house fires involving solar panel and batteries has triggered calls from an electrical association for a more rigorous compliance and inspection program to weed out dodgy operators.
The calls by the National Electrical and Communications Association (NECA) follow a spate of fires this year, including one that destroyed an Adelaide home in the middle of the night in February, and with a lithium battery blamed for razing a house in Perth in January.
The latest Fire and Rescue NSW annual report shows the number of fire-related incidents serviced involving solar panels and batteries has tripled over the past two years to 151 last year. This follows a 20 per cent rise in solar fire incidents from 2019 to 2020.
The electrical association, which represents around 6,000 electrical subcontractors, claims post-installation inspections are rare and not well-regulated despite the growing trend of renewable technology being installed in homes.
NECA national policy and technical director Paul Brownlee said without higher inspection rates and improved measures to help spot unlicensed and poor electrical work, fire-related electrical incidents could experience the same level of growth as installations.
“NECA has long advocated for standardised and more frequent rates of inspection to weed out dodgy solar and ­battery installations,” he said.
“Simply put, these technologies must be installed and managed by skilled, fully ­licensed electricians. Sadly, we are seeing more incidents where this has not been the case.
“It is imperative that government-backed enforcement programs for the inspection of electrical work are co-ordinated and strengthened to prevent more incidents from occurring.” NECA has advised anyone looking to install solar or any renewable energy technology such as lithium-ion batteries to ensure they receive a certificate of compliance from a fully licensed installer.
