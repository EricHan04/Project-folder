THE global energy crunch will slow the shift away from coal-fired generation, according to the International Energy Agency, which warned on Tuesday high fossil fuel prices would not necessarily aid in a quicker shift to green energy.
The IEA released its annual medium term forecasts for natural gas markets on Tuesday, saying the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which has seen a scramble in Europe to sever its reliance on Russian gas and coal exports – had pushed up prices to the point of “fuel switching and demand destruction” in international gas markets.
The IEA warned that tight gas markets, even combined with soaring coal prices, would not lead to a quicker shift to renewable energy across global markets. “We now expect less than 2 per cent growth (or about 75 billion cubic metres) for the 2021 to 2024 period compared to the previous 5 per cent (or 210 bcm),” the IEA said. “However, such a revision does not necessarily imply that gas consumption is on course to achieving its transition to net zero emissions.” About 40 per cent of the lost gas market growth would come from the “slowdown in switching to gas from other fossil fuels, as high gas prices delay conversion plans and investment or limits access to gas supply for newly built or converted infrastructure”, according to the IEA.
