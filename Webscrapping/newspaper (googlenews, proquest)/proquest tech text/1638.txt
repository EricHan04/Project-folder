THE agriculture sector will get a $18.7m boost in the state budget, with initiatives including a $1.3m-a-year AgTech Adoption Program to promote the take-up of technology by primary producers.
Drought support will result in $5.2m to fund another round of the On-Farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme to help more than 200 drought-affected farmers install water storage, pumps and pipes.
There also will be $4.4m to establish the South Australian Drought Resilience Adoption and Innovation Hub at the University of Adelaide’s Roseworthy campus as well as centres at Minnipa, Port Augusta, Orroroo, Loxton and Struan.
Rural financial counselling and family and business support mentor programs will receive $2.2m over three years, while the grains sector will receive $1.7m over five years to deal with the potentially devastating lens snail that can wreak havoc on crops and pastures.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham, pictured, said these initiatives would build on existing programs to help boost South Australia’s agriculture industry.
“SA’s regions are crucial for the future prosperity of our state, contributing around $29bn to the state’s economy and supporting more than 180,000 jobs,” he said.
“Many farmers have had a challenging few years with drought, bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. “By expanding our support programs such as the On-Farm Emergency Water Infrastructure Rebate Scheme we will fast-track economic recovery and better prepare our farmers for future adverse events.”
