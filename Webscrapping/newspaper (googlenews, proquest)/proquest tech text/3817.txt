THE next generation of mobile technology is live in Murray Bridge with Telstra's 5G coverage now available in the rural city as part of the national roll-out.
According to Telstra, the recent work on the 5G network upgrade will also deliver improved 4G capacity and speeds in the local area for those that don't currently have a 5G device.
Telstra's regional general manager for South Australia Mark Bolton said residents with 5G enabled handsets will notice they are connected to the new 5G network in locations across Murray Bridge with the full roll-out across the town to be completed this year.
"(Benefits include) speed; people think of speed but for us it's also about capacity so what it means is we can connect more devices to the network," he said.
'We can connect 100,000s of devices to one cell and that is really important for the future for things like automated vehicles, robotics and anything connected to the internet."
Mr Bolton said while the network would cater for the future requirements, the benefits of upgraded network would be felt by anyone accessing 5G.
"If you experience slow speeds on your mobile data network on what ever device you are using, 5G provides that relief," he said.
For people to access 5G, they will need a new 5G device and a 5G-ready mobile or data plan to connect to Telstra 5G as existing 3G or 4G phones will not be able to access 5G.
Telstra media manager for South Australia and Northern Territory Chris Marks said Telstra had carried out extensive testing on the safety of the network.
"In terms of safety, we've done extensive Electro Magnetic Energy testing on our 5G service and have found the EME levels to be similar to 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi and well below internationally recognised safety limits, and in many cases, over a thousand times lower," he said.
