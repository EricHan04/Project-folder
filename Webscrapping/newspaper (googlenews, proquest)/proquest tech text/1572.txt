A bold strategy to help Victoria's agriculture industry has been announced by the state government.
Minister for Agriculture Jaclyn Symes said the government was putting money back into farmers' pockets and helping tackle climate change, through its Agricultural Energy Investment Plan, which has made $30 million available for enhancements to energy efficiency and productivity on farms.
"Many farmers and growers are showing that it is vital to the future of agriculture to adopt new ways of doing things to gain a competitive advantage and set themselves up for the future," Ms Symes said.
"We need to ensure the whole industry can take advantage of new approaches that not only protect our industry and our state's enviable position as a leader in agriculture, but also help it grow to its full potential."
