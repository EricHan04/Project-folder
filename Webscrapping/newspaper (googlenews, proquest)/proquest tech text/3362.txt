More than a couple of swells
LONDON theatre troupe The Swell Mobis making waves at this year’s Cabaret Festival – and a few of its shady characters felt right at home during a visit to Port Adelaide’s docks.
CONTINUED PAGE 2 More than a couple of swells FROM PAGE 1 “We’ve always been trapped in this old tavern … it was kind of strange seeing the outside world,” said Jordan Chandler, who plays the show’s ringmistress character, Elizabeth.
“It was like we’d snuck out – it was part of our world still.” Ms Chandler likens The Swell Mobto a virtual-reality environment set in the 1800s, populated by con artists, sideshow acts and people with mysterious agendas.
“I imagine it as stepping through a TV screen into your favourite PlayStation game. It’s a mixture of free-roaming, exploring, discovering and interacting,” she said.
“People have understood that they have to put in as much as they will get out of the show.” Flabbergast Theatre’s The Swell Mob has multiple performances each day at the Artspace in the Festival Centre from tomorrow until the Cabaret Festival ends on June 22.full details on every show at advertiser.com.au/cabaret-adviser
