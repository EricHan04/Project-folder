FARMERS could soon be turning manure into money.
The Federal Government is funnelling almost $3 million into a new project to maximise the benefits of manure for agriculture and the environment.
The project uses cutting-edge techniques such as robotics, photographic 3D scanning of nutrients and solid separation technology.
Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said animal health company Scolexia would lead the project, which is designed to increase farm profits with manure and nitrogen management.
Mr Littleproud said the project could lead to farmers producing better fertilisers and soil improvers from manure products. It could also generate power on farmers from biogas, cutting carbon emissions.The technology will be trialled on farms across Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.
