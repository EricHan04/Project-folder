Naracoorte High School has tranformed its former music and drama space into a $2.5m STEM Building, with state-of-the-art technology, including robotics and virtual reality.
Emceeing the event were school captains Tayla Standley and Oscar Peltz, and Principal John Harris credited the previous principal, Kim Grant, for also helping to see the project to completion.
The new STEM Building is highly visible and accessible, with both indoor and outdoor working spaces.
Member for MacKillop Nick McBride officially opened the STEM Centre with Mr Harris, and mentioned that with the multitude of defence jobs lined up for Port Adelaide in the future, then more students graduating as engineers, designers, etc., the better for the state's economy.
Labor MLC Clare Scriven was also in attendance, with Labor candidate for Barker Mat O'Brien.
In the 2016 State Budget under the previous Weatherill Government there was $250 million allocated to school STEM facilities, with Naracoorte High School receiving $2.5m as well as $5m from the Building Better Regions Fund.
Mr O'Brien stated that with the Australian job market rapidly changing, students gaining STEM skills was vital, and that the state should take pride in facilities such as the Naracoorte High Stem Centre.
Ms Scriven was pleased to attend the opening, and was impressed by the innovative technology that students would have access to.
Once the ribbon was cut, attendees were invited to see the facilities and have some afternoon tea.
