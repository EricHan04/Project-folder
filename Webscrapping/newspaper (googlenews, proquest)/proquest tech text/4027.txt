START-UPS and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) in defence and space industries will be given access to the latest digital technologies at a new $2 million collaboration facility at UniSA’s Mawson Lakes campus.
The university will invest $1 million in the new Industry 4.0 Testlab, with up to $1 million in additional funding provided by the Federal Government.
Industry 4.0 – also known as the fourth industrial revolution – represents the increasing impact of emerging technologies, including robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and Internet of Things.
UniSA Vice-Chancellor David Lloyd said the Testlab would become operational by the middle of the year, forming part of a national network of six similar sites.
“Our Testlab will be one of the most advanced industry collaboration facilities in the country, providing South Australia with a gateway to the future of manufacturing,” he said.
“Given the state and federal governments’ objective of building an internationally competitive defence and space industry, the Testlab’s focus will be on supporting SMEs in those supply chains.”The Testlab will support rapid prototyping – a process used to build a physical model from a computer drawing – and will also offer a platform to create digital twins of a product to optimise product performance.
