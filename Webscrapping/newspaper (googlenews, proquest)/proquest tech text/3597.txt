A WORLD-first, global three-race series of electric-powered “flying car” grands prix will kick off at a yet-to-be disclosed course later this year, after extensive testing in the South Australian outback.
Backed by international heavyweights such as luxury Swiss watch company IWC Schaffhausen, global logistics giant DHL and cloud computing outfit Acronis, the Airspeeder EXA Series will involve pilots controlling the Alauda Aeronautics Mk3 EXA race-craft at speeds of more than 190km/h.
Races will be held in three venues around the globe, with the events streamed to a global audience.
The races will take place on an “augmented reality” course, which overlays a virtual environment on the physical world through the use of simulator technology.
The companies behind the project, Airspeeder and Alauda Aeronautics, were both founded by Adelaide-based Matt Pearson, who is also a founder of nanosatellite company Fleet Space Technologies.
Mr Pearson, who has been working on the project since 2019, said he brought together technical experts, engineers and designers from Formula 1, high-performance automotive and aviation backgrounds, including people from McLaren, Brabham, Rolls-Royce and Boeing, to bring the Mk3 to life.
Up to four teams, each with two remote pilots, drawn from aviation, racing and eSports backgrounds, will take part. Airspeeder hopes to transition to human-piloted races by next year.
