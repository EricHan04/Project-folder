A $125M “green cement” project aimed at cutting up to one million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year has been launched at Port Adelaide.
Backed by a $20m federal government grant, local construction materials supplier Hallett Group is spearheading the project. The primary manufacturing operation will be based at Port Augusta – employing about 50 people – and will operate using renewable energy sources.
The operation will process fly ash from the closed Port Augusta power station into supplementary cementitious mat­er­ials (SCMs), which offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional clinker-based cement products.
It will also use by-product materials sourced from Nyrstar’s Port Pirie smelter and the Liberty Whyalla Steelworks, delivering improvements to their on-site carbon footprints.
Hallett chief executive Kane Salisbury said cement manufacturing was responsible for 8 per cent of global carbon emissions, or three billion tonnes of CO2 a year. He said that by making its own SCMs locally, Hallett would be able to replace imports of clinker-based cement, which currently represents about half of the country’s cement consumption.
“The project will future-proof Australia’s access to SCMs and green cement, which becomes increasingly important as locally produced sources of SCM-quality fly ash diminish in the coming years in line with the reduction of coal-fired power generation,” he said.
“By building this sovereign manufacturing capability, Australia can become an international leader in the benefits and use of SCMs in green cement.” The project is expected to initially reduce CO2 emissions by 300,000 tonnes a year, rising to one million tonnes. A separate facility is being built at Port Adelaide to position Hallett for potential export growth.
