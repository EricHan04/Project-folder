CONSUMERS are demanding Aussie-made products as the pandemic throws the globalised marketplace into disarray.
The Australian Made campaign has seen a surge in businesses applying to use the familiar kangaroo logo with inquiries in SA tripling.
Usually, Australian Made gets about 60 inquiries a month, with fewer than 10 from SA. During the pandemic, that has lifted above 300 nationally with more than half signing up.
“We’ve had a 400 per cent increase in people joining Australian Made,” the organisation’s chairman, Glenn Cooper, said.
Research by Roy Morgan for Australian Made has found that since the pandemic, consumers are clamouring for local products, with nearly half of people surveyed more likely to check labels for the country of origin.
“Importantly, 93 per cent of consumers said they trusted Australian-made products,” Mr Cooper said. “People will pay a bit more, not a massive amount more, because they understand quality and because they think we’ve let too much of our manufacturing go.” Among those riding growing demand is Tindo Solar, the only Australian manufacturer of photovoltaic panels. It used to supply about 40 installers.
“Now we’ve got more than 600,” chief executive Shayne Jaenisch said. “Companies are coming to us and saying they’ve got a client who wants to buy solar but insist it’s made in Australia.” Tindo is investing $7m to expand its Mawson Lakes operations and said with more government support it could expand further, creating sufficient volume for a supply chain within Australia for components.
It said this would create jobs and lower power costs.
