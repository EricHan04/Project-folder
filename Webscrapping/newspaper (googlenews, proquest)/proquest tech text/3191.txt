HOME WORK
IT CAN be tempting to turn your bed into an office, dodge video calls, and work at whatever hour suits you – but experts are warning Australia’s growing work-from-home army to avoid these pitfalls so they stay productive and healthy.
While working from home will be easier for some more than others, they recommend establishing a home office, a routine, negotiating with housemates, and turning on the webcam during conference calls to maintain social contact.
Onya managing director Hayley Clarke, who manages a team of employees remotely, said life outside the workplace didn’t need to feel isolating, and many workers actually talked to clients and colleagues more during the day.
“I don’t have less communication working from home, because I’m still talking to people on Skype or over the phone all day, every day,” she said.
“It might not be the same kind of chitchat that you get when someone drops into the office, though, and you have to learn to read auditory cues more than visual cues.” Australian Institute of Management WA chief executive Professor Gary Martin recommended workers made sure they kept their computer’s video camera turned on when participating in video conferences and calls over platforms such as Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts, and GoToMeeting.
He said face-to-face contact was an important part of staying socially connected, although people needed to negotiate with others in the household who were also working from home.
“Having a shared calendar about your commitments can help because you don’t want to have people invited over when you’re in the middle of a teleconference,” Prof Martin said.
Ms Clarke said it was also important to establish a dedicated work location at home, prepare daily task lists, and to set regular work times.“The biggest recommend­ation about working from home is not to roll out of bed and stay in your PJs. Otherwise, it’s hard to stay motivated,” she said.
