Aimed at developing entrepreneurship and technology capabilities amongst farmers, the Farmers2Founders program is presently holding its inaugural bootcamp.
Participant and Training Paddock founder Ashlea Miles said the three-month program had a lot to offer farmers developing an agtech startup.
"When you are not familiar with technology development, when it's not your first career, there are so many terms that you don't understand, so many different legals and people you need to talk to," she said.
"Farmers2Founders offer a really specific scaffold program. Every business is different so they offer a tailored 'check the box' plan.
"The very clear stepping stones created by the Farmers2Founders team help you progress in that three-month period, it prevents you getting overwhelmed."
Ms Miles said so far, she had found the bootcamp challenging, in a good way.
"You need to be resilient and dynamic," she said. "Even though it was challenging, all of the teams have been able to adapt, change and manage. The aim is to get the best out of us and I think that is what they are doing."
