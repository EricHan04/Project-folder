ADELAIDE satellite company Myriota has joined forces with global water pump manufacturer Grundfos to develop a new remote monitoring device for farmers.
The companies are launching a range of satellite-connected, solar-powered water pumps that will enable farmers to remotely monitor water pumps and tanks. Using satellite-connected sensors, they are designed to save farmers the time, fuel and labour needed to manually check their water infrastructure for monitoring and maintenance.
A mobile app will track water levels in storage tanks, and deliver real-time data alerting farmers when supply is low or when maintenance is required.
Grundfos Australia area managing director Sam Ryder, pictured, said introducing satellite connectivity to its range of pumps would deliver significant improvements for farmers.
“Solar water pumps are already cost-effective, flexible and reliable off-grid solutions using renewable energy, and this partnership further enhances the system, empowering users with essential data for their daily operations.” Several of the new pumps are already in operation at trial sites across north Queensland, the Northern Territory and regional NSW.
Myriota chief executive Ben Cade said smart technology was playing an important role in the management of water resources in agriculture. “New space IoT (Internet of Things) communications are unlocking previously impossible or impractical use cases at a dramatically lower-cost,” Mr Cade said.
