The longest-running archaeological field school in Australia has reflected on its efforts in teaching students about Aboriginal culture.
The Barunga Community Archaeology Field School is part of the postgraduate program in archaeology and cultural heritage at Flinders University.
For two decades the Adelaide-based university has been bringing city students to Barunga to learn about Aboriginal culture from Aboriginal people.
The school is located on the Bagala clan lands of Jawoyn Aboriginal people.
Flinders University's Professor Claire Smith and Gary Jackson have run this annual archaeological field school since its inception in 1998, working with a community they have maintained close contact for 30 years.
Professor Smith said the Barunga field school's 20-year milestone points to its ability to reach beyond archaeological experiences and build significant cross-cultural understanding through developing relationships between all of the school's participants.
