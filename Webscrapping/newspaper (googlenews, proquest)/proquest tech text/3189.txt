SUPERCARS wants to hold an Eseries championship with its star drivers alongside its real-world title fight next year, after the early success of its virtual racing competition.
Filling a void for racing fans while the on-track action is on hold, Supercars has been buoyed by the level of interest in the first two rounds of its 10-week All Stars Eseries.
Featuring drivers doing battle online from simulators at home, the Eseries last week attracted a wildcard entry from Formula One ace Max Verstappen in a Red Bull Holden.
Supercars chief executive Sean Seamer was thrilled with the early success of the virtual racing and confirmed an Eseries could run again in off-weeks during its championship next year.
“That is something that we would be looking at,” Seamer said. “We’ve had a good (start), we’ve got to make sure that we deliver this series over the next eight weeks. That’s our number one priority.
“But if it continues to be this successful, it’s certainly something that we can look to execute on our off-weeks.” Last week’s second round featuring Verstappen attracted a peak audience of 104,000 and an average of 74,000 viewers on Fox Sports. The average audience was higher than some rounds at the track.Supercars has held an Eseries with professional gamers the past two years, but this is its first online title battle for its drivers.
