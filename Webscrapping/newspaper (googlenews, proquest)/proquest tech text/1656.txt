A saleyard record was made when heifer prices hit $3760 and cows hit $4040 yesterday at the Angus Feature Female sale at Naracoorte.
Spence Dix & Co director Jono Spence said the whole breeding female job went to a new level.
"It was like we have never seen before and well and truly exceeded everybody's expectations," he said.
"Vendors were just blown away, with records on all fronts."
Mr Spence said it was a record by a mile for the saleyards and companies.
"We were well supported by the upper and lower South East districts and AuctionsPlus was very active with cattle travelling as far as Queensland," he said.
The best presented pen of pregnancy-tested-in-calf heifers was awarded to Naranga Pastoral Co for 24 PTIC heifers which made $3480.
