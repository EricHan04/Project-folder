THE population of Ceduna dropped following the introduction of a cashless debit card for welfare recipients three years ago, researchers have found.
Professor Eve Vincent, from the Department of Anthropology at Macquarie University, visited Ceduna nine times between mid-2017 and early this year for her research.
She said locals told her about people who had moved or registered their address as somewhere outside of the town to avoid being issued a card, which was introduced in March 2016.
Census figures show Ceduna’s population dropped by almost 50 people – or 3 per cent – up to August 2016.Researchers found the population in two other remote regions with the cashless debit card – Wydham in NSW and Kununurra in Western Australia – also lost residents.
