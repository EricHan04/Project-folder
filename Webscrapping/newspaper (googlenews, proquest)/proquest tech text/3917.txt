TECH billionaire Richard White has pledged at least $50m from his personal fortune to transform science, technology, engineering and maths learning in Australian schools.
The money will underwrite a new interactive digital curriculum for STEM, to be developed in partnership with education authorities. Mr White, founder and chief of logistics software firm WiseTech Global, said his initial commitment would be $50m and that he was in it for the long haul.
“I am prepared to go strong on this for 10 years,” he said on Thursday. “I need to give something back to society.” The Grok Learning program has already proved successful at Craigmore High School, where it was rolled out to Year 9 students in 2021 and is now provided to all year levels.
“The data we collected around student engagement convinced us to implement it across all year levels in 2022,” the school’s digital technologies teacher, Kristian Allen, said. “It’s a great way for students to engage with coding and programming in a way that is fun and rewarding, yet rigorous in its teachings.” Student Tyler-Ann Boddey, 13, said: “I really enjoy the Vex Robotics program … I can program the robots with the coding program I learnt on Grok – it’s so cool.”
