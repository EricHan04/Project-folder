A series of Livestock Ag Technology Expos will take place across South Australia this month, including at Wudinna.
The expos are part of the state government's $7.5 million Red Meat and Wool Growth Program and will showcase the latest innovation and encourage greater adoption of AgTech on farms.
Primary Industries Minister David Basham said the expos would give livestock farmers the ability to better understand technologies available to them.
"We are focused on putting the mechanisms in place to encourage greater adoption of technology on-farm and the livestock expos are another cog in that chain," he said.
"The $7.5 million Red Meat and Wool Growth program is improving the productivity and profitability of the sector. Adopting livestock technology can enable this by improving on-farm productivity and building more resilient livestock businesses, through better decision making.
"These expos will give our red meat and wool producers the opportunity to hear from, and talk to, providers about tech solutions that are readily available."
Mr Basham said that as the state and primary industries recovered from the ongoing effects of drought, bushfires and COVID-19, the program was providing a strong pathway for the industry to be even more resilient and innovative with its focus on farming smarter through technology adoption, skills development and enhancing biosecurity.
The Wudinna expo will take place from 9am to 5pm on Thursday, February 18 at the Wudinna Football Club.
The expo is free, but registration will be essential due to COVID-19 restrictions.
