A HISTORIC satellite-tracking antenna (pictured) that symbolises the Northern Territory’s role in space exploration has been officially listed as a heritage object by the NT government.
Built in Belgium in 1966, the satellite-tracking antenna was one of three parabolic dish antennae originally installed at the Gove Down Range Guidance and Telemetry Station at Gulkula on the Gove Peninsula, under a program led by the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO).
The antennae tracked the downrange path of rockets launched from Woomera in South Australia as they passed over the Northern Territory. In the early 1970s, the antennae were relocated to a facility near Adelaide until the Arnhem Land Historical Society began lobbying for them to be returned to their site. NT Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Chansey Paech said: “This is a unique and fascinating part of our history which shows that the Northern Territory is, and has always been, a strategic location for space exploration.”
