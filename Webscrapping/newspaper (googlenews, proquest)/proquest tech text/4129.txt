PASTURES - how to grow them and how to make the most of them - was the major topic at the DairySA Innovation Day, held yesterday in the South East.
A large crowd of dairyfarmers were on hand to hear from a range of international and Australian experts on what the future holds for feed availability and the potential of robotics to ensure feed efficiency is maximised.
The guests also heard from recently-appointed DairySA regional manager Tom O'Grady and Dairy Australian managing director David Nation about how the situation is looking for the industry.
Mount Gambier chiropractor David Beltakis also provided a range of exercises and advice to help minimise injuries while working on-farm.
The day ended with a dinner, with speaker Noel Ogilvie, of the Ogilvie Group, who spoke about his experiences growing up in the SE as his family built their business.
There was also plenty of opportunities to speak with service providers and fellow dairyfarmers to share ideas and experiences.
