YOU can now explore the state’s 2150km dog fence from the comfort of your own home.
A new “virtual dog fence” has this week been launched to demonstrate the state of the dilapidating structure, which was established in the state’s Far North to keep wild dogs out of pastoral areas.
The State Government has collated 1781 photos of the fence, taken by members of the state’s Dog Fence Rebuild Committee.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister Tim Whetstone said the project highlighted the need for a $25 million rebuild.
The overhaul, to begin in the coming months, will take about five years; its cost being covered by $10 million from the state, another $10 million from the Federal Government and $5 million from the livestock industry.
The project is expected to create up to 63 full-time jobs and 26 suppliers will be involved in the rebuild.“Our pastoral areas are facing challenges of drought and bushfire recovery, and this project will provide extra employment opportunities in our regions while limiting the impact of wild dogs on our $4.5 billion livestock industry,” Mr Whetstone said.
