IMPROVING the growth and management of pastures was the key focus at the DairySA Innovation Day at Mount Gambier, late last month.
A large crowd of dairyfarmers were on hand to hear from a range of international and Australian experts on what the future holds for feed availability and the potential of robotics to ensure feed efficiency is maximised.
The guests also heard from recently-appointed DairySA regional manager Tom O'Grady and Dairy Australian managing director David Nation about how the situation is looking for the industry.
Mount Gambier chiropractor David Beltakis also provided a range of exercises and advice to help minimise injuries while working on-farm.
Stock Journal's ELIZABETH ANDERSON went along to the event.
