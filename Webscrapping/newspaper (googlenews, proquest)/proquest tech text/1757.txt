A Victorian based software platform startup is taking the administrative burden out of stock sales, streamlining and digitising the process in an effort to reduce workload and increase traceability.
Agrinous is designed for use by stock agents and yard management but could ultimately benefit the entire industry. Managing director Joel Rockes said the software had been picked up by a number of agents in Victoria, and also had customers in Wagga Wagga and Naracoorte, South Australia.
"As a cloud based system, the agent can jump on their phone or iPad and build their consignments or presale catalogue, then once the animals arrive we interface directly to the EID readers and then follow the current paper based process but in a digitised form," he said.
"The National Vendor Declarations are also loaded into the platform, so the end result is the buyer gets a consolidated list of post-sale summaries and NVD's.
"Once the last agent hits balance and confirm or reports are out within five minutes."
Attending the Bendigo Farmers2Founders day, Mr Rockes said agtech events and accelerators could help move good ideas into a mature business.
The Farmers2Founders pre-accelerator Big Ideas program is an eight-week remote program tailored by experts in the innovation sector, offering participants support to get their new ventures off the ground.
