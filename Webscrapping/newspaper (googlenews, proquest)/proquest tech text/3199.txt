National Science Week in Victoria: event highlightsSwarm â€“ Parkville
From nanobots to native bees, superorganisms to social media â€“ is it better to be part of a pack or go it alone?
Part exhibition, part experiment, SWARM uncovers the very essence of collective behaviour and questions what drives us to be social.
More than half of Earthâ€™s 7.9 billion people live highly urbanised lives; increasingly connected through social media and digital interfaces, we share our lives to hordes of followers, crowdsource ideas, digitise our workforces, and become part of global political movements.
Swarming behaviour underlies nearly everything: swarms of social insects, murmurations of birds, molecular movements, swarm algorithms driving choices, and even swarms of drones and nanorobots helping (or hindering) the very essence of what it means to be human.
At a time of unprecedented societal upheaval due to the current global viral pandemic, Science Gallery Melbourne is delving into the science and art behind what it means to be part of a pack.
Saturday 13 August - Saturday 3 December. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/science-gallery-melbourne-swarm/parkville

Saturn up close â€“ Ballarat
Saturn is at opposition on Monday 15 August. This occurs when Saturn is closest to the Earth, with the sun on the other side of Earth. Itâ€™s literally the best time to see the ringed planet through the telescope at Ballarat Municipal Observatory and Museum.
Visitors to the observatory will learn about Saturn, the sun, and observing the night sky.
Saturday 13 to Saturday 20 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/saturn-up-close/mt-pleasant

Hydrogen energy 101 â€“ Hawthorn
Hydrogen is a promising solution to tackle climate change and it will also create jobs across a range of sectors. But what is hydrogen? How is it applied in daily life? Why is it important? And, most importantly, how does it impact your future?
Ask the experts at the Victorian Hydrogen Hub at Swinburne University of Technology.
Monday 15 August and Tuesday 16 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/lunch-and-learn-hydrogen-101/hawthorn
Media enquiries: Breck Carter, breckcarter@swin.edu.au or 0402 015 037
Dr Kim Beasy, Victorian Hydrogen Hub Research Fellow, is available for media interviews.
Moving images: virtual reality helps us accept death â€“ Carlton
Guided meditation in virtual reality could comfort the dying in their final moments.
Psychology scientist Dr Nicholas Van Dam will talk to artist Efterpi Soropos about using virtual reality to improve people's moods, even in the saddest circumstances.
Efterpi has been creating art in palliative care, transforming bleak patient rooms with light, sound and video.
Can guided meditations in virtual nature environments affect our mood and emotions? Can a virtual environment help soothe those in palliative care? And can it ever compare to meditating on the side of a mountain or deep in a forest? Ask the experts.
Tuesday 16 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/immersive-mindfulness-can-real-life-compare-with-digital-worlds/carlton

A band of physicists go on a road trip to explain quantum and dark matter â€“ Bendigo and Stawell
Dark matter accounts for 85 per cent of all the matter in the Universeâ€¦ but we donâ€™t yet know what it is. Australia is a key player in the quest to find out.
Quantum technologies are crucial in the hunt for dark matter, and theyâ€™re already used in smart phones and cars, medical imaging, manufacturing, and navigation. But todayâ€™s technologies capture only a small fraction of the potential of quantum physics.
The National Quantum & Dark Matter Road Trip takes a bunch of quantum and dark matter physicists to cities and towns around Australia, travelling from Brisbane to Perth via Coffs Harbour, Sydney, Canberra, Bendigo, Stawell, Adelaide, Kalgoorlie and many more towns in between. This follows a successful tour of southern WA in National Science Week last year. Science joke: if you know where they are, you donâ€™t know how fast theyâ€™re travelling!
Bendigo: Tuesday 16 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/national-quantum-and-dark-matter-road-trip/bendigo
Stawell: Wednesday 17 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/national-quantum-and-dark-matter-road-trip/stawell
Other dates and locations. More information: www.qdmroadtrip.org.
Media enquiries: Fleur Morrison, fleur.morrison@unimelb.edu.au or 0421 118 233.
Multiple experts involved with different legs of the tour are available for media interviews, including dark matter enlightener Jackie Bondell and UWA particle physicist Ben McAllister.
Misinformation puts the Q into 5G â€“ Parkville
Radiation scientists are ready to correct phoney information.
Scientists will publicly measure wifi and mobile phone tower radio waves in Melbourneâ€™s busy, built-up inner city to address health concerns about 5G networks.
Radiation experts from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency will counter misinformation about the 5G rollout and bust the myth that mobile phones cause cancer.
Wednesday 17 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/misinformation/parkville
Media enquiries: David Sibenaler, eme@arpansa.gov.au or 03 9433 2211
Photo and filming opportunities as scientists measure radio waves from sources like broadcast radio, WiFi and mobile phone towers in Melbourne.
Electromagnetic energy experts are available for media interviews.
Who wants to be an epidemiologist? â€“ Torquay
Doctors, nurses, and paramedics save lives one at a time. But public health researchers save lives by the thousands!
Ask real epidemiologists (not the armchair type) what itâ€™s like to have a career in public health, working in this era of major global health issues.
Hear from three epidemiologists at different stages of their careers:
Professor Catherine Bennett â€“ The Alfred Deakin Professor, Chair in Epidemiology, Deakin UniversityProfessor Emeritus Joan Ozanne-Smith â€“ Monash University Department of Forensic Medicine.Jessy Hansen â€“ Data Analyst and PhD student.

They will share their motivations and passions, their experience in the field and in the lab, how they got their start and where they are today in an event at Torquay Library.
Thursday 18 August. Event details: www.scienceweek.net.au/event/who-wants-to-be-an-epidemiologist/torquay
