RINGSIDE The Australian Government has given Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea a helping hand to recover from the devastating African swine fever outbreaks.
ASF is a viral disease with no effective vaccine, which can survive for long periods in uncooked, frozen, or cured pig-meat product and persists in contaminated pig pens for at least 30 days.
Federal agriculture Minister David Littleproud said Timor-Leste received $180,000 and PNG an extra $205,000 to help combat the contagious virus and mitigate future outbreaks. “African swine fever hit Timor-Leste in September 2019. Between ASF and severe flooding that has blighted the country, Timor-Leste has lost more than 100,000 of its 420,000 pigs,” he said.
Meanwhile, PNG has battled ASF since March 2020. “We understand how the animals play a cultural and economic role in both countries and the serious effects these outbreaks are having on their communities and livelihoods.
“In Timor-Leste, about 72 per cent of urban and rural households keep pigs. About 600,000 households in the PNG highlands rear nearly 1.8 million pigs, producing some 27,000 tonnes of pig meat annually.” The virus is spread primarily by close contact between pigs. While ASF is exotic to Australia it is present in many neighbouring countries and is widespread throughout Asia.
