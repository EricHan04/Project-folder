GRAINGROWERS that attended the Southern Australia Durum Growers Association's annual event on Wednesday, were granted unique access to the San Remo Milling facility as well as hear the latest durum wheat research at an information forum.
Attendees were also given an opportunity to tour the University of Adelaide's Waite campus to view the breeding centre and witness robotics at work in the plant accelerator.
Forum speakers included the University of Adelaide's durum breeder Jason Able who spoke about the performance of durum varieties Artemis and Spes, while San Remo's grain research coordinator Fil Ciancio discussed milling qualities of new durum varieties.
AgCommunicators managing director Deanna Lush was also a guest speaker at the event's dinner.
SADGA chairman Simon Honner hoped the interactive program provided graingrowers with a renewed interest in growing high quality durum wheat.
