The growing ties between France and South Australia have resulted in two military officers spending three months in Adelaide researching cybersecurity.
The lieutenants were given placements at IT services company DXC Technology and submarine designers Naval Group in a partnership organised by UniSA.
“It was very valuable for me and the company,” said Caine, 21, who worked at DXC.
“I was looking at security in Industry 4.0 and how to implement that in defence.” Industry 4.0 involves the increasing digital presence in manufacturing with machine learning, robotics, data analysis and sensors.
Caine and colleague Riwan, 23, are mustered in the French Defence Force procurement agency Direction Générale de l’Armement.
They also are studying for a Master of Science in software engineering at ENSTA Bretagne in Brittany.
Riwan, who worked on the submarine project, said he had enjoyed discovering a bit about Australia.
“It’s also been a good opportunity to make networking connections and gain further experience from Naval Group,” he said.
UniSA director of defence Matt Opie said the industry placements demonstrated the strong relationship between UniSA and French research organisations.
“It is a great collaboration between UniSA, a French research institute and two international companies with large offices in Adelaide – DXC Technology and Naval Group,” he said.“We see this as the beginning of a collaboration that will endure for decades.”
