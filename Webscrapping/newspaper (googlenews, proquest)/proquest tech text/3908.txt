UNIVERSITY boffins will join forces with techies from Optus to develop a revolutionary system that detects bushfires within minutes and rapidly extinguishes them.
A partnership between the telco and Australian National University, to be announced today, will develop hi-tech solutions to predict, identify and extinguish blazes before they become deadly.
The program, set to run until 2024, will use technology such as infra-red cameras, drones, robotics and satellites. A first step will be to develop an autonomous ground-based and aerial fire detection system. ANU Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt, pictured, said: “This will detect and attack fires before they grow.”
