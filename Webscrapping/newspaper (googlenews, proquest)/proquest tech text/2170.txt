SAVVY solar households are joining a growing number of people cashing in on the energy crisis by switching to “virtual power plants” (VPP) across the state.
Each VPP is a network of solar panels and batteries controlled by a central operator.
Using wi-fi and software, the operator can dispatch energy from the batteries to play the market.
In South Australia, there’s already a dozen VPP operators offering financial incentives and other benefits that sound too good to be true, such as 45c/kWh paid for excess solar when the grid needs it most.
“These incentives can include discounted solar and battery systems or lease-to-own plans, reward payments, low electricity tariffs, back-up protection, and credits on your electricity bill,” according to the government.
Brighton-based SolarQuotes founder Finn Peacock has changed his tune on solar batteries now that feed-in tariffs are falling and electricity rates are rising.
He advises customers to shop around, compare quotes and consider energy plans with time-of-use tariffs before handing control over to a VPP.
“The irony is that a lot of people want a battery to take control of their electricity, but really what they’re doing (in a VPP) is giving control of their electricity to someone else,” he said. “So it is important you read the small print and see what they can and can’t do.” Mitcham residents and businesses are being invited to take part in a bulk-buy of solar and battery systems through the council’s Community Renewable Energy Program.
Mitcham Mayor Heather Holmes-Ross said the idea was to help ratepayers “save money and at the same time save the planet”.
Andrea and Jeremy Pluck, who run their business Remedial Therapies SA out of their Bellevue Heights home, were “thrilled” to upgrade their solar system and join the virtual power plant. Ms Pluck said the scheme just added to the obvious “benefits of the solar panels”.
