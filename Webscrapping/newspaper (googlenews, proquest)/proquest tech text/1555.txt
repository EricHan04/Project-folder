PRIMARY Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham was on Kangaroo Island this week to announce funding for an extension officer, who will help establish and manage the Island's new $1 million AgTech Hub.
Mr Basham said central to the uptake of cutting-edge agricultural technologies and information was ensuring primary producers understood the solutions and how to appropriately deploy, connect and integrate these options on-farm.
"Demonstration of technologies in local conditions will make this easier for producers," he said.
"The KI AgTech Hub will also allow us to work directly with entrepreneurs and developers to ensure they understand the key challenges on KI and develop solutions that are grounded in the realities of primary production there."
Agtech demonstration farms will be established on the island, with the first field days and tours expected to be held in 2022.
