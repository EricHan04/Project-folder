The seeds will spend six months in space then be sent to the schools for planting.
Rostrevor Year 5 student Marcus said the students were eager to see what effect the space trip would have on the plants.
“It is good to have young people like us involved because we are interested in seeing what happens to the seeds and because we will be here in future years to keep the project going,” Marcus said.
“We already know that astronauts that have been in space for a long time need to exercise to stop their bones getting weak, so perhaps something like that could happen to the seeds and affect their growth in some way.”

The Space Wattle project is a joint initiative of the Australian Space Agency, Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and NASA as part of the Japanese-led Asian Herbs in Space program.
The One Giant Leap Foundation in Australia selected schools based on their entries to participate in the project.
The foundation will provide educational support and send the schools 12 seeds each – six that have been to space and six that have not – to grow and compare.
The space seeds will return to the US after their time on the International Space Station, then go via Japan to Australia.

“The students are so excited that learning they will be doing in class will be assisting real scientists and engineers with research,” Glenelg Primary teacher Kelly Rivett said.
“This launches our students into authentic STEM learning opportunities that will inspire them to think beyond the school boundaries.”
Glenelg Year 3 student Lorcan said: “It’s one small step for a kid, one giant leap for the wattle.”
