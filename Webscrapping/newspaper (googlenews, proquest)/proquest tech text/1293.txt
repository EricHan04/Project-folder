THEY’RE not rocket scientists, but a group of researchers is reaching further into the space sector.
The UniSA group – accountants, behaviourists, supply chain experts and other professionals – want to apply their skills to growing the sector in South Australia.
The 29-member group will meet leaders from business and government this week to offer teaching and research capability.
“We’re well-placed to support the industry,” UniSA director for defence and space Matt Opie said of the uni tapping into its capability in humanities, arts and social sciences.
On Friday, the group will meet business about their needs, including what should be taught for the space workforce of the future.
“We’re all really passionate about space,” co-ordinator of the Space and Cosmology Research Group Basil Tucker said.
“This is a way of grafting on to our professional area – like finance, sleep studies, entrepreneurship or creativity – on to the space sector,” he said.
Dr Tucker is working with a US colleague on an accountancy course tailored for space.
“Humanities have always been critical to space exploration,” he said. “Children don’t have posters on their bedroom walls of the formula for gravitational acceleration. They have posters of Yoda – that’s art. “So accountants, lawyers, supply-chain managers, painters and poets – they all have a place in space.”
