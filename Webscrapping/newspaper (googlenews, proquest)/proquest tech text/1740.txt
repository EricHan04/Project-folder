THE World Electronics Forum will be held in South Australia in December when the event returns to Australia after a 16-year hiatus.
The WEF2019, which attracts leaders from global electronic companies, has been secured as a result of a winning bid by Electronics Industry Development Adelaide.
Times have changed since the low-key affair held in Canberra in 2003, EIDA president and WEF2019 convener Donald Kay said. “Electronics is an advanced industry that touches the lives of everyone, and this forum presents an opportunity to discuss issues beyond the latest smartphone features,” Mr Kay said.
“There are some real and current issues and opportunities for the industry like the lack of STEM students and new processes and capabilities that need to be taken up urgently.” Mr Kay said the local industry, made up of about 300 companies, which employ about 11,000 staff was excited about the opportunities surrounding the event.
“Our electronics industry and research institutions will be on show to the world, from Agtech, Circular Economy and Climate Change, to Space, Sensors and IoT.” The state’s electronics industry makes an estimated $4 billion contribution to the SA economy annually, he said.
“Hosting the World Electronics Forum for the first time in Australia in 16 years is the realisation of a major ambition for our association, with the potential to bring thousands of industry leaders and VIPs from over 50 countries to our city, Mr Kay said.
“ We expect strong delegations from France, India, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, USA, Vietnam, Malaysia and of course China.” Recent WEF meetings have seen representatives from Panasonic, Tatung, Universal Microelectronics and Airbus.A full program on the event from December 4-6 at Adelaide Convention Centre is expected soon.
