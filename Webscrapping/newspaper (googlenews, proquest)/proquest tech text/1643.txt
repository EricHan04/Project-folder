The Trapview Predictive Pest Network developed by Adama, offers growers and agronomists across Australia the first integrated network of smart insect traps for predicting pest pressure.
Trapview utilises revolutionary technology in a fully integrated system to provide an innovative, simplified solution for monitoring insect populations.
It operates by capturing images and providing digital recognition of lured pests using Trapview smart traps.
Pest populations and their dynamics are then shared across the network allowing for near real time monitoring of pest movements across a large area.
"The network provides agronomists and growers with near real time insight on pest activity within their region, allowing greater understanding of pest pressure, optimised choice and precise timing of control options," Adama Australia agtech and innovation manager, Andrew Newall said.
"Subscribers not only receive pest information within their region but also state based pest pressure for the network they subscribe to, saving agronomists time when monitoring crops for insect activity, as well as allowing more effective communication with their growers."
The Adama Trapview Predictive Pest Network monitors keys pests across key growing regions in Australia, including Helicoverpa (armigera and punctigera), Etiella, Green Mirid, Diamond Black Moth and Codling Moth.
