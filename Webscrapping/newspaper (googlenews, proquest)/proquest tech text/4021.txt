Seven Scouts from the 3rd Bathurst (All Saints Cathedral) Scout Troop had the adventure of a lifetime at the Australian Jamboree from January 4 to 14.
Held at the new Bend Motorsport Park at Tailem Bend, located less than 100 kilometres south-east of Adelaide, the Jamboree attracted more than 10,000 Scouts from around the country and internationally.
For 10 days, the Jamboree became South Australia's ninth largest town.
The Jamboree offered many exciting activities including dragon boating, ice skating, flights in a two-seater motorized glider, working with drones, robotics, African drumming, water activities, raft building, and cart racing on the V8 car racing circuit. There were also nightly concerts.
One of the biggest challenges at the Jamboree was the Woodhouse Activity Site, where each Scout participated in a 27-hour adventure including archery, high ropes, abseiling, a maze, an inflatable obstacle course, and the famous Woody's Challenge Hill.
The challenge is designed to develop skills in pioneering, navigation, camping, and problem solving.
There was also an opportunity to visit the city of Adelaide.
Despite the searing temperatures during the Jamboree, though, the Scouts wouldn't have missed it for anything.
The next Australian Jamboree will be held in three years time.
