This list of 21 as chosen by us, includes both well-known faces and some of the quiet achievers of the industry — from heads of multimillion-dollar companies to TikTok stars, business innovators and community builders.
Brett Hosking
Fifth-generation farmer Brett Hosking has been chairman of Grain Growers Ltd since 2018.
Mr Hosking, who has also served as Victorian Farmers Federation grains group president and federation vice president, has used his position at Grain Growers to develop sustainability targets for the grains sector and advocate for more support for farms in the wake of the NSW floods.
Marc Drouin
Marc Drouin heads the Canadian Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments) global natural resources team.
PSP Investments made its first farmland foray into Australia in 2014, and now has a portfolio of joint venture pastoral, broadacre cropping, orchard, grain storage, water and agricultural processing assets estimated to be worth more than $4b.
In recent years the company has invested up to $3b a year expanding its global farming footprint – more than half of which has gone into Australasian operations.
In 2021, through its Australian Food and Fibre joint venture, it was estimated to have paid about $500m for the Auscott Limited cotton farming, processing and marketing business in NSW.
In 2020 it paid $854m for the ASX-listed Webster Limited business, whose assets included a significant cropping portfolio.
PSP is also the key financial backer of Daybreak Cropping, who operates seven aggregations in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia covering more than 75,000ha. It also owns and operated approximately 45,000ha of cropping land through its BFB joint venture in Temora, NSW.
Peter Vallance
Peter Vallance, 30, became the unlikely face of Australian agriculture to tens of millions of curious young people when he started a TikTok account.
Mr Vallance, who goes by MalleeBoy3490 on TikTok, works on his family’s cropping property at Ouyen in Victoria’s Mallee region.
He started the account as a way to create and save memories of his old cattle dog Spud.
His account, which now also features regular videos with Patrick the alpaca and Spud’s sister Pip, took off.
He has now accrued 12.3 million likes and more than 700,000 followers on the platform.
“To have those young people come and go ‘I really like look of your life, how do I get to do that?’ has been amazing,” he told The Weekly Times in May.
“The cross section of people I talk to is unbelievable.”

Rutherglen farmer Ashley Fraser is director and grains council president of the Victorian Farmers Federation.
He was elected to the position unopposed in 2017, and has used his role to campaign for farmers on a range of issues including their right to repair their own farm machinery.

He has been GPA deputy chair since 2013 and is also chair of GPA’s Biosecurity Committee, a group with a crucial role in helping government and industry to manage national biosecurity issues for Australian grain producers.
At the time of his appointment he told The Weekly Times the biggest challenges for the industry were maintaining profits to growers and the establishment of Grains Australia.

Northern NSW mixed grain farmer Xavier Martin operates a wheat, canola and sorghum farm at Mullaley, and is the current NSW Farmers vice president.
He has used his platform this year to advocate for more support for growers as they battled NSW’s mouse plague.
He has also called for more scrutiny of foreign investors and the tax advantages they hold over local farmers.
Andrew Weidemann
Mixed grain farmer Andrew Weidemann is the Grain Producers Australia southern region director and former GPA president.
In an interview this year, Mr Weidemann told The Weekly Times his greatest achievement in his eight years at the helm of GPA was bringing the grain industry together.
“We have got all the state farming organisations sitting around the table,” he said.
His other big achievement was developing the database of levy payers of the Grains Research and Development Corporation, he said.
“It was important that GRDC recognise where their income comes from and that researchers understand that growers are funding their work.”
Rebecca Reardon
Farmer Rebecca Reardon is the current treasurer of NSW Farmers. She has been actively involved with the organisation for more than six years, with roles as chair of the Grains Committee and on the executive council.

Under his leadership, GrainCorp has returned impressive profits.
In the week before the Australian Securities Exchange closed for the year on December 24, GrainCorp reached its highest share price since the 2020 share market crash of $7.90.
With a closing price of $7.85, the grain company’s market capitalisation is nearly $1.8 billion.

The family were pioneers of the cotton industry in southern Queensland’s MacIntyre Valley.
David and Kim Coulton and their three sons, Andrew, Thomas and Sam now farm about 5500ha of irrigated cotton and 7000-8000ha of cereal crops, as well as running Angus breeding cows, and operating a 2000-head feedlot.

He has garnered more than 9000 followers on Twitter and regularly tweets about agricultural policy, climate change, and most-recently, the fallout from widespread flooding and heavy rain in northern NSW.
He’s not afraid of taking a stance on issues he is passionate about.
“When you are a farmer, and you are on social media, you feel like you are under siege,” he told The Weekly Times in 2019.
But he hasn’t given up, continuing to share the challenges and delights of farming with his growing follower-base.
Renee Anderson

Phillipa Lawson and her husband, Skeet, run her family’s 1500-hectare wheat, barley and lentil operation at Pinnaroo, in the South Australia Mallee near the Victoria border.
Inspired by a desire to improve the diet of her two young daughters, Mrs Lawson began producing red lentil flour, a great source of protein that can be mixed in to a range of dishes.
After taking part in an intense start-up accelerator program called Farmers2Founders in 2020, she launched a new brand – The Pinnaroo Farmer – the same year.
She now sells red lentil flour directly to customers through an online shop, her local Pinnaroo bakery and through a wholefoods store in Adelaide.

The Weekly Times understands the purchase was Alberta Investment Management Corporation’s first direct investment in agriculture in Australia.
