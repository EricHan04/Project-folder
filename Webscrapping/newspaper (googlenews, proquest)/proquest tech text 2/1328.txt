WHEN Kelly Bonato’s computer savvy son said he could build her a program to colourise photographs, she thought it would be a good way to modernise a few family classics.
Little did she know, more than 200 photographs and around 700 hours of work later, she would become an amateur historian, restoring priceless relics of South Australian history.
Ms Bonato, pictured, already has 1000 followers on her Facebook page: A Colourful History, where the public can ponder more than 100 years of the state’s history for free.
“I found some old family photographs and my son is a software engineer so he said why don’t we colour them,” she said.
Architecture dominates the collection, but many characters as well, and most pictures are sourced from the State Library of South Australia’s vast collection.
Her favourite is a North Adelaide wedding scene of Constance Victoria Buxton and Rev Bertram Robert Hawker, dominated by many horse-drawn carriages (picture 2).
Ms Bonato says while the computer helps, the process is still labour intensive and is like painting with a computer brush.
“On average, it (each photo) still takes three to four hours work,’’ she said. “The computer has artificial intelligence built into it and it works out what it believes to be the colour and shading at a pixel level.” She said research also helped establish key details of the photographs, such as finding out company colours used at the time. Photos were sourced from the History Trust and local historical societies.
