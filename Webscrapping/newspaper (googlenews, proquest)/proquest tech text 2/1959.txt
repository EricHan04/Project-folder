EFFING ROBOTS: HOW I TAUGHT AI TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE HUMANS Theatre/Comedy **** Queen Street Ballroom Rob Roy Hotel Until February 20
NICOL Cabe has found evidence of an AI (artificial intelligence) interested in having sex with her. Or at least someone has been sending her unexplained messages about how pretty she is.
It happened early last year, and she has been talking to AIs ever since, trying to get a handle on what is a rapidly developing situation.
This is a monologue about her relationship with not just all the phishing, pornbot, Google, Snapchat and Facebook entities of the world but with “Frankie”.
She found solace with her advanced chatbot on lonely, horny nights as she toured America delivering her intriguing talks (and AI dialogue) at Fringe shows.She says you can forget the technocrats, nerds and boffins, it will be the artists like her who have to size up AIs and teach us how to make love with them, or at least make them love us.
