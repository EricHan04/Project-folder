KANGAROO Island’s feral cats are in the firing line as Natural Resources employs smart technology to eradicate the animals.
“Felixer” machines, which photograph animals’ movement and shape and then squirt poison at the creatures’ fur, will be used on public land, and approved private properties, on the Dudley Peninsula.
It follows a six-week trial on a 12sq km property, which found 13 of the 20 cats who encountered the machine were poisoned and killed.
Natural Resources Kangaroo Island feral cat eradication program manager Mike Greig said six machines would now be added to the organisation’s raft of measures, which had received $2 million in funding, to kill wild cats.
Mr Greig expects later this year, the program would also be bolstered by a new cat-proof fence across the island’s narrow isthmus, separating the peninsula from the rest of the island. When targeted by the machines, cats groom themselves and die after ingesting the approved 1080 poison, which is also commonly used elsewhere to bait dogs and foxes.
“The overall aim is to clear out the Dudley Peninsula of feral cats and if we have success in the Dudley Peninsula, we can roll that out onto the whole of the island – but that’s a long-term plan,” Mr Greig said.
He said during the trial, 1300 animals encountered the machines, and of those, three were inaccurately targeted – a brushtail possum, lamb and turkey. It was believed the poisonous gel missed the possum, and the lamb and turkey were unharmed.
Mr Greig said across Australia, wild cats had a $144 million impact on the livestock industry each year.RSPCA SA animal welfare advocate Rebekah Eyers said while the organisation recognised the need to control introduced animal species, methods should be “as humane as possible”.
