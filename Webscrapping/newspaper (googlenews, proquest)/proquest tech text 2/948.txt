Energy project boost
FIFTY jobs have been created with the start of construction of the Happy Valley Reservoir solar farm.
Site works to install about 30,000 solar panels start today on the northern section of the reservoir reserve, adjacent Black Road and South Road.
Environment and Water Minister David Speirs said early site preparation, including the planting of native vegetation along South Road, had already been completed.
“The zero-cost energy future is an ambitious project for SA Water to use renewable energy to reduce its largest operational expense – electricity,” he said.
“In exciting news for southern suburb communities, Happy Valley is one of the reservoirs across South Australia which we will be opening up for recreational access, such as kayaking and fishing by the end of 2021.
“The solar panel installation at Happy Valley Reservoir is just one of 33 sites across the site which will be part of the zero-cost energy future project.’’ Following an engagement process with nearby residents the solar array was reconfigured to fit in a smaller area and a 40m buffer of pine trees was retained between the panels and nearby Black Road.
“This is a fantastic result which still enables SA Water to achieve its energy management target as well as preserve and enhance the surrounding natural environment,” Mr Speirs said.
The site preparation works will involve trenching to accommodate underground electrical cabling and establishing internal access tracks.
The installation of solar panels will follow, with additional electrical infrastructure and fence installation rounding out the project. The construction is expected to take about six months to complete.
