AUSTRALIA risks becoming a “digital banana republic” if it doesn’t embrace artificial intelligence, an Adelaide science expert says.
Professor Anton Van Den Hengel said Australians may be worried about robots taking their jobs, but “the truth is AI creates jobs – thousands of them overseas, where other countries are spending billions of dollars on the industry”.
Professor Van Den Hengel is the director of the University of Adelaide’s Australian Institute for Machine Learning, an anchor tenant at Lot Fourteen.
He said the nation must engage with the technology or it would end up missing out on a huge opportunity.
“We will wind up a digital banana republic,” he said yesterday, referring to the political concept of countries becoming unstable because of reliance on a single, critical import.
The CSIRO says we must make sure that AI delivers benefits greater than the cost; does no harm; complies with laws and regulations; protects privacy; is fair and transparent, as well as accountable and subject to human challenges.PAGE 21: ISSUES
