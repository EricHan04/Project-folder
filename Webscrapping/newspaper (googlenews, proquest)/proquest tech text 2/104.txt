ADELAIDE-BASED sports drink start-up PREPD has won a prestigious award at this year’s Australian Institute of Food Science & Technology awards.
The company was named a joint winner of the AIFST Peter Seale Food Industry Innovation Award, which recognises new developments that have achieved a successful commercial ­application across the Australian food industry. Perth’s Australian Natural Biotechnology was the other winner.
PREPD chief executive ­Andrew Perry said the award was a further endorsement of the sports drink product launched in 2018.
“Even when drinking to thirst, athletes can still experience dehydration sufficient to reduce performance by over 5 per cent,” he said.
“PREPD changes all this by boosting the impact of any sports drink and making water work harder, helping athletes perform at their peak, longer.
“Over the last 12 months we have had a number of elite athletes from UCI cycling teams, Olympians, Commonwealth Games, Ironman, AFL, Cricket Australia, SACA, Trail Running and V8 Supercars use the ready to drink range in the professional sports space.
“We are now receiving requests from US-based sports teams.” PREPD was developed after 20 years of medical research between Yale and Flinders University, and is designed to be consumed before and after physical activity.
