ADELAIDE flying car start-up Airspeeder has pulled off a landmark 400m “drag race” in the South Australian Outback as it gears up for full-scale grand prix racing next year.
The company, which has attracted global sponsors such as Swiss watch firm IWC Schaffhausen and DHL, has released footage of two of its Mk3 EXA flying cars hitting speeds of up to 150km/h as they race through the sky in the Flinders Ranges.
Airspeeder was founded by Matt Pearson, who is also a co-founder of nano satellite company Fleet Space Technologies, and its staff include former employees of motorsport icons Ferrari, Brabham, Rolls-Royce and McLaren.
The drag race, over 400m from a standing start, pitted two teams from Alauda Aeronautics – a sister company to Airspeeder – against each other.
The unmanned Mk3 EXA vehicles, which are capable of speeds nearing 200km/h, and eventually, the company says, up to 300km/h, are piloted from the ground and have a “virtual force field’’ around them created by technology designed to make sure they don’t hit each other.
The recent race was a straight shot over 400m, at about 10m off the ground, with Team Bravo beating Team Alpha by 3.2 seconds.
Mr Pearson said it was a key test ahead of a grand prix season which will take place in “soon to be unveiled locations” next year. Airspeeder’s ambition is that the vehicles will move from being remotely piloted to crewed, with the current crop of pilots being drawn from eSports and civil, military and acrobatic aviation.
