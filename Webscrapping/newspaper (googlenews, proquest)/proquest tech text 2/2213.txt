CLOCKS will turn back one hour from 3am on Sunday, as daylight savings ends for those living in NSW, Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT.
From April 3, those living in the country's south east will grab extra morning sunlight, while evenings will grow darker, sooner. Smart technology, like computers and phones, will likely adjust timing automatically, though analog items such as clocks and microwaves will need a manual touch. Daylight savings will start again six months from now, October 2.
