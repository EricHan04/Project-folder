GIVE them a bit of that old razzle dazzle as you step out for winter nights with our beautiful city aglow. Take inspiration to shimmer and shine from these gorgeous designer looks which I had the pleasure of styling for our shoot on location in the Illuminate Pavillion in the East End. This pop-up exhibition space houses Wisdom of AI Light, from the Istanbul-based visionaries at Ouchhh Studio. This centrepiece of Illuminate Adelaide 2022 is a multisensory experience thatâ€™s putting the art in artificial intelligence with a jaw-dropping piece from the pioneers of data paitnings and light sculpture.
Back for its second year, Illuminate Adelaide is a celebration of innovation, art, light, music and technology shining throughout July with a full program of free and ticketed events.
Prepare to be blown away by such events as Light Cycles at the Adelaide Botanic Garden, Light Creatures at Adelaide Zoo, and the family-friendly City Lights installations in the CBD.
