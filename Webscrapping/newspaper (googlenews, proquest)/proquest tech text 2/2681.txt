TELSTRA is on target to cut a further 2000 jobs by the end of the year, chief financial officer Vicky Brady says.
The redundancies are part of Telstra’s T22 cost-cutting program, which involves getting rid of 8000 staff across its direct workforce.
“By June, we expect to be more than 90 per cent through our T22 target to reduce our direct workforce by 8000 net roles, and to have completed that by the end of the calendar year,” Ms Brady told the Macquarie Australia Conference on Wednesday. Ms Brady said Telstra has already retrenched 6000 staff across its direct workforce and a further 16,00 across its indirect workforce.
“At the same time, we have recruited more than our planned 1500 roles, with skills in new areas such as software engineering, data analytics and cyber security,” she said.
Telstra shares gained 1.4 per cent, or 5c to close at $3.55 yesterday while the ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 7095.8 points. OpenMarkets Group chief executive Ivan Tchourilov said there was broadbased buying across most sectors.
