CENTRE Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie has outlined a comprehensive “wishlist” to support Scott Morrison or Bill Shorten should the May 18 poll end with a hung parliament.
The Mayo MP outlined her far-ranging demands to The Advertiser. “I would be seeking a properly funded, wide-ranging Federal ICAC, serious political donation reform including real-time disclosure, a federal royal commission on the River Murray, real action on climate change and strong protections for The Bight,” Ms Sharkie said.
The list comes as the Centre Alliance MP, a former Liberal staffer, hinted that it could be harder to form government with Mr Shorten.
“I supported the present Government on confidence because I recognise my community is a non-Labor seat,” she said.
Ms Sharkie’s proposals have been supported by her Senate colleagues Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick.
But Senator Griff added that reforming the Spam Act and truth in advertising laws for political parties were also high on the party’s priority list.
Ms Sharkie this week joined independents from around the country in a social media video that has come under fire.
Liberals campaign spokesman Simon Birmingham said the ad, backed by No Fibs, an organisation whose founder Margot Kingston is a longtime campaigner against Liberal governments, raised some questions about who the Mayo MP wanted to see in The Lodge.
“Rebekha Sharkie is colluding with organisation like No Fibs that want to see the Liberal Government defeated and Bill Shorten prime minister,” he said.
“You really have to ask the questions – what is it that Rebekha Sharkie is hoping to get out of the next parliament?” Ms Sharkie said the advertisement was funded through crowd-funding. “I wanted an SA voice on this important issue of climate change on a potential crossbench,” she said.“After all, I am stating the position of Centre Alliance.”
