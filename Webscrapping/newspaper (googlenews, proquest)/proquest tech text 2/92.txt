SORRY Eddie (McGuire), Tassie isn’t simply a wart on the bum of Victoria. Unlike NSW or Queensland, we are part of the great Australian rules tradition. We don’t want or need to be lumbered with a Vic team looking for a home. Stan
TASMANIA wants a stand-alone team. North Melbourne can sort through its own problems. Tom
EDDIE has completely misread the room here. Tassie wants to fill the stadium in Tassie colours and to connect with a team of our own. We don’t just want more games, there’s only so many NM vs GWS games a neutral supporter will go to. I get that NM are struggling but that needs to be dealt with separately. Simon
NO is the short answer. Amanda
POSSIBLY the silliest idea of the year. So Tasmania would never ever play in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth or Canberra? David
COMPLETELY disregards the wishes of the Tasmanian folk who want a stand-alone club. Ken
TASMANIA says no, but thank you Eddie. Shaun
EDDIE is 100 per cent correct, North will still be nothing in 10 years. Jason
I DON’T often say this about Eddie, but great idea. Rather than making one team sacrifice by changing states, or creating a funding nightmare for the AFL/Tasmanian government (good luck getting a new stadium now), spread the pain. Great for my Kangaroos too. Denise
NOT convinced that this is anything other than a save North Melbourne fantasy. Mervin
TASMANIA deserve a team, much like Sydney, Brisbane, Gold Coast (not even a capital city), Adelaide and Perth. John
TO me 19 sounds too many. Kathy
DON’T be so blind, people. Eddie knows a start-up Tassie team is only a dream and is trying to think outside the square so some form of footy is played in Tassie. George BASED on Eddie’s shortsighted plan, North would never play a home-and-away game in Queensland, NSW, WA or SA. What a joke. Steve
