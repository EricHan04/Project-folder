DIAMONDS coach Lisa Alexander says Netball Australia couldn’t have punished Maria Folau for publicly supporting her husband Israel but stresses the sport is fiercely inclusive.
New Zealand and Adelaide Thunderbirds sharpshooter Folau has come under fire for endorsing Israel’s crowd-funding efforts in his legal fight against Rugby Australia, who terminated his contract over a homophobic social media post claiming “hell awaits” gays.
Netball Australia took no action against Maria Folau but Australian netball legend Liz Ellis slammed the decision.
Alexander was more diplomatic, submitting her employer had little choice.“I just don’t think they can,” Alexander said ahead of Friday’s start of the World Cup.
