A STATE Government-sponsored corporate function has come under fire for featuring a burlesque entertainer who performed a striptease.
Several attendees have reacted strongly to the decision to have award-winning Fringe burlesque performer Anya Anastasia provide the entertainment at the Blockchain Summit gala dinner, organised by ADC Forum, at Adelaide Oval on Monday night.
Adelaide businesswoman Sonya Weiser was at the event and said several attendees walked out in disgust. She said Anastasia, pictured, took the stage and, after a couple of songs, began to strip, removing her stockings and underwear, but had a second pair of underwear underneath.
“It was a bit icky. It was a corporate event,” said Ms Weiser. “Most people in the audience were just sitting there deadpan, like ‘what is going on?’” Ms Weiser said the choice of entertainment highlighted that the IT industry was “very male dominated” and there was “lots of unconscious bias”.
She has lodged an official complaint with the organisers.
“I recommended that in the future, the event organisers are very clear to the (performers) that you require only G-rated, family-friendly performances that everyone can watch,” Ms Weiser said.
Premier Steven Marshall was also at the event.
Anastasia said she was “a little surprised” at the feedback and that the routine was meant to be an empowering tongue-in-cheek performance.
“Obviously, it’s a shame if it wasn’t taken in the spirit that it was intended,” Anastasia said.
Attendee Georgia Heath left the function early and agreed the performance was inappropriate.
“I really want to stress that my issue was not with this performer – I would hate for her to get a bad rap for this,” Ms Heath said.Both Mr Marshall and ADC Forum have declined to comment.
