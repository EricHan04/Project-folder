ENTREPRENEURS THE last year was a banner one for Australia’s start-ups, with the nation generating a record number of unicorns – privately owned billion-dollar tech companies – and 2022 already looks even more fruitful.
With money still cheap and venture capital investors looking to place lucrative big bets on the next Atlassian and Canva, there are at least five Australian tech start-ups set to crack ‘unicorn’ status over the next 12 months.
Seer Medical has doubled its growth every year and is looking to ramp up that momentum in 2022.
The five-year-old epilepsy medtech company employs nearly 200 staff, and is generating more than $10m in revenue annually.
Fintech start-up Brighte, dubbed the ‘Afterpay for solar’, has raised $520m in debt and equity since launching in 2015. Atlassian co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes is among its backers. Led by former Macquarie banker Katherine McConnell, Brighte has helped over 80,000 households get access to solar energy through a buy now, pay later zero interest payment plan.
Software start-up Employment Hero tripled its valuation to $800m in 2021 and is a hot bet to crack the $1bn mark in 2022. The company, which offers a cloud-based HR platform for small and medium-sized businesses, has more than 300 staff.
Linktree, which started life as a simple tool for Instagram users, has raised $US55.57m ($77m) in funding to date and has 19 million users. “Things are growing very quickly ... we’re getting a new user every two and a half seconds,” said co-founder Alex Zaccaria. Octopus Deploy, which offers a tool used by software developers to automate the deployment of applications, is getting close to lifting its valuation above $1bn. It raised $US233m from New York’s Insight Partners last April.
