MT BARKER resident Luke Humphrys may only be 15, but he is already making a name for himself as an entrepreneur and artist.
Luke is the creator of Rusty Recycle Art – a $20 start-up which turns landfill into one-off sculptures and garden objects, which he sells on Facebook Marketplace.
The Heathfield High School student started the business last year as part of a Year 8 $20 Boss project, helping young people explore entrepreneur skills and small business. The aim was to run a successful and profitable social enterprise that would give back to the community in some way.
In Luke’s case, turning treasure into art helped combine his passion for welding and the environment.
It’s also helped create a platform to raise awareness for childhood cancer, with 10 per cent of his sales donated to Canteen.
Luke said his creations were generated from rusty recycled materials, including old shovels, rakes, nuts and bolts, which he sourced from friends, family, local farms, and properties in the Adelaide Hills.
“I love welding so I’m using these skills to help look after our environment where I can,” he said. “I get to make something for others to enjoy (and) I love watching the joy on people’s faces when they buy my work.” Luke’s welding talent will be on display at next month’s SALA Festival where he will exhibit his work Rust Reloaded at the Garden Depot in Mt Barker.
