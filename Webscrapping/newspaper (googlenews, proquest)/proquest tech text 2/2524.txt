AUSTRALIANS are being reminded to take extra precautions with their passwords in the lead up to Christmas as $1.8m was lost to hackers this year.
The government’s Australian Digital Health Agency is calling for everyone to beef-up their password security as part of tomorrow’s International Computer Security Day.
Chief executive Amanda Cattermole said even sharing your passwords with family and friends, or using the same passwords for multiple accounts, could put you in the eyes of scammers.
But the biggest password sin was choosing simple, easy to guess passwords. “Having weak passwords is comparable to leaving your front door open when you leave home or leaving your car unlocked,” Ms Cattermole said. Verizon’s cyber crime report found while 80 per cent of people said they aware of password security, 81 per cent of password breaches involved weak and default passwords.
