REGULATION CRYPTO assets should be regulated in the same way as other financial products to avoid a duplicate regime and excessive red tape, according to the Financial Planning Association of Australia.
In a submission to Treasury, FPA’s head of policy, strategy and innovation, Ben Marshan, says the regulation of a financial product or service should not depend on the technology underlying the asset.
“To this point, investment in crypto assets is as much in relation to the asset itself, such as an ether (ETH) coin or a non-fungible token (NFT), as a bet on the sustainability of the technology platform supporting the asset, for example the Ethereum blockchain,” Mr Marshan said. “Ensuring consistency will reduce confusion for Australian investors and financial service providers.” There is also an urgent need to protect consumers, not only from the risks of fraud and theft of assets, but also from an education and portfolio construction perspective, the FPA said. But it does not support regulating crypto exchanges outside the current financial services regulatory regime.
