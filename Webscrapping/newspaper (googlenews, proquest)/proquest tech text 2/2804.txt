Investors had a fourth consecutive week of gains on the ASX, but an analyst said there were signs their focus had shifted to short-term troubles.
A second consecutive day of losses for the Australian share market and its slimmest weekly gain for November show investors may have refocused on the troubles of the pandemic, an analyst says.
The S&P/ASX200 benchmark index closed lower by 35.3 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 6601.1 on Friday.
The All Ordinaries was down 32 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 6816.8.
There was no trade in US markets due to the Thanksgiving holiday.
The ASX200 achieved its fourth consecutive weekly gain in a month filled with enthusiasm over promising coronavirus vaccine test results, and the US election results.
However, the 0.95 per cent improvement this week was the slimmest.
Deep Data Analytics chief executive Mathan Somasundaram believed investors had switched focus from vaccines to short-term troubles.
"The market is looking at the US going through a dramatic rise in infections, and the economic consequence," he said.
US hospitalisations for COVID-19 reached a record of more than 89,000 on Wednesday. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped last week to the highest level in more than a month.
The US government is yet to deliver financial stimulus to boost the economy.
"There is a lot of short-term risk in the market," Mr Somasundaram said.
He expected the US dollar to fall further, and global investors to continue buying Aussie banks and miners due to the stronger Aussie dollar.
