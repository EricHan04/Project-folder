TWO thousand skilled jobs will be created within five years at a service hub operated in Adelaide’s heart by global professional services firm PwC.
This is a dramatic expansion in employment since The Advertiser last March revealed at least 300 jobs would be created within 18 months at the national hub, designed to train skilled workers in high-demand fields.
The centre, which has a strong focus on digital and technology roles including cyber security, cloud computing, analytics and integrated infrastructure, was officially opened on Thursday morning by Premier Steven Marshall.
Of the first 271 people employed, 35 per cent have moved to Adelaide from interstate to work at the Rundle Mall hub. Mr Marshall said PwC’s SA expansion “strengthens our state’s position as a hub for digital health innovation and as a world leader within the hi-tech sector”.
