CLOSE friends Natalie Henry and Catherine Britt were enjoying a drink together one evening last summer when talk inevitably turned to songwriting.
Henry was going through a relationship break-up, which she described as "the hardest one" she's experienced, and was finally emerging out the other side. The secret to her recovery, Henry explained to Britt, was "weed, wine and women".
"I said something about the things that get me through the night," Henry said. "And she said, 'that's a great idea for a song', so we just started to write through the night."
The result was the honky tonk single Weed, Wine and Women, the first track from Henry's forthcoming second album, due in September.
The single has already attracted high-profile praise. You Am I frontman Tim Rogers described the song as, "grand-honky-tonk writ, sung and played with all the trouble and charm that the best has," and alt-country heavyweight Shane Nicholson said, "from post to post, it doesn't get much more authentic and believable than this."
The album was recorded in February at Rocking Horse Studios in Byron Bay following a successful $15,000 crowd-funding campaign and was produced by Britt and Michael Muchow.
Henry is the quintessential late bloomer. At 34 in 2016 she and her ex-husband Brock Henry released their debut album Cold Love as The Wayward Henrys and in 2019 she released her maiden solo record, Apple & Pride.
Henry said album No.2 is closer to the sound she's been striving for.
"It's really great when an artist finds that," she said. "It takes a long time. Sometimes it takes 20 years to find the sound. I've been doing this six years and I feel like I've finally found my sound."
Henry launches Weed, Wine and Women at a secret show on May 28 in Newcastle.
