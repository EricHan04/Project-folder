THE local equity crowdsourced funding (CSF) industry is booming according to Australian market leader Birchal, which says the September 2021 quarter was the industry’s biggest ever.
Birchal is behind about three quarters of Australia’s CSF activity, and said on Monday that there was a 110 per cent increase in successful offers year-on-year, with 24 successful CSF offers completed for the quarter, raising more than $19.4m from over 10,000 investors.
Medical cannabis start-up Medibis was Birchal’s most successful campaign, raising $1.8m, while Good Earth Dairy raised $1.6n and Beer Cartel $1.4m.
“It’s been a cracking start to the year, exceeding even our expectations for the first quarter of FY22, with some tremendous results from several high quality campaigns,” Birchal co-founder Matt Vitale, pictured, said.
“We also passed a significant milestone, having funded our 100th successful CSF offer with Tiller Rides on its second campaign under the CSF regime. Unfortunately, Covid lockdowns meant we couldn’t celebrate as we’d planned to, but we’re hopeful we can make up for it when we break through $100m on the platform, which could be early next year.” Birchal sparked 17 of the quarter’s successful offers, with rivals Equitise hosting four and OnMarket two. According to Birchal, since the commencement of Australia’s crowdsourced funding industry more than 168 Australian SMEs have raised over $118m.
