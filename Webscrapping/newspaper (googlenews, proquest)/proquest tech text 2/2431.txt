YEAR OF THE WOMAN TERESA'S PICK To celebrate International Women’s Day, TERESA PALMER talks to her ‘mama tribe’ about family, passions and finding balance. And reminds all mums out there ‘you are doing a sensational job’ THERE’S something about Adelaide, it has a little magic to it and it’s not just the high I have from our daily after school trips to The Garden of Unearthly Delights that’s doing it.
Adelaide is humble and beautiful, comforting and homely, yet vibrant and pulsing in a way that feels exciting and enticing. Having spent the last 12 years abroad I have called many cities home, but Adelaide is our forever home, the place that we have chosen to raise our children and never have we felt so happy.
My positive experiences in Adelaide have a lot to do with the families I’m interacting with, the communities we’re being welcomed by.
Today I want to shine a light on a handful of mothers that I have come to know and love – a mothers’ appreciation piece of sorts.
We must recognise how important it is to cultivate self care; to choose a daily non-negotiable that helps us to recharge and rewind so that we can be our very best selves (mine is an uninterrupted bath).
To the mothers out there fighting to make ends meet, juggling the responsibilities of raising kids while trying to maintain a healthy and happy family unit, I acknowledge you. I know it can be tiring, I know sometimes it feels like your voice isn’t being heard or that your effort goes unnoticed but it is important, beautiful, commendable work and you are doing a sensational job.
I’ve reached out to my local mama tribe whom are navigating the peaks and valleys of child rearing, and asked them how they find balance in their ever increasingly busy lives.

The holy grail. It’s a constant juggle. At the heart of it, it’s learning to say no and being surrounded with supportive, hands on family and friends who pick up a lot of the slack. We’re not there yet though, I’m still learning that to look after my family better, I need to also look after myself.
What’s the best thing about raising kids in Adelaide?

It is something I have struggled with since having our daughter. I don’t have much time to myself which I know is not always a good thing, but I accept it is the way things are at the moment.
