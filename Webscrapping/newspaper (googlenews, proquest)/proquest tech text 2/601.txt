COULD the world’s best league buy the rapidly growing and improving NBL? According to NBL commentator and former league MVP Corey “Homicide” Williams, it’s a realistic chance of happening.
“This league is blowing up,” Williams said on SEN Radio in Melbourne. “We’ve got a start-up company and it has started blowing up after five years. What begins to happen to the start-up company? It generates interest and people want to buy in.
“Don’t be surprised if you hear at some point that the NBA wants to buy the NBL. That is what companies do. They eliminate the competition and buy them.” As for concerns the NBA might want too much control, Williams declared: “You don’t know Larry Kestlelman. LK don’t play that.”
