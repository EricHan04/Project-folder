DOCKLESS electric scooters could be the next transport experiment to hit the Adelaide streets if Singaporean start-up Beam Mobility Solutions has its way.
The company, which is run by former executives of bike share company Ofo, which pulled out of Adelaide and Australia mid-last year, was in town last week talking to Adelaide City Council and the State Government about its plans.
Beam’s vice president of corporate affairs, Christopher Hilton, said the company would need a government exemption to allow its scooters to be ridden on the roads, which is currently illegal.
There is already an exemption in place in Queensland, and Beam has about 1000 scooters on the way to Brisbane, Mr Hilton said.
The scooters will be dockless, similar to other bike share schemes, but Mr Hilton said their business plan involved paying people to charge scooters overnight, which would get many of them off the streets.
The company would also have its own staff to ensure the scooters were deployed in the correct areas where use was high, and that they were adequately charged.
Mr Hilton said the company was also keen to discuss with the council the best way to ensure the company did not cause a problem with the use of public land.
“Our goal is essentially to have most vehicles off the street every single night. What we think makes sense is our vehicles being used for trips from 500m to 3km,” he said.
Features to increase safety are likely to possibly include speed-limiting new users, and requiring supplied helmets.A spokesman for the government said it was considering the issue.
