QUEENSLAND researchers have been awarded a grant of half a million dollars to develop an app which will help users better manage and diagnose potential sexually transmitted infections.
Using artificial intelligence to analyse a user’s patterns of behaviour, symptoms and demographics, researchers hope the app would reduce the barriers to STI testing and diagnose illnesses earlier.
The four-person USQ team, and a colleague from the University of Queensland, have been awarded a $500,000 grant from the Australian Government.
Led by USQ’s School of Sciences Dr Zhaohui Tang and Professor Yan Li, Dr Tang said the app would be secure, with patient data privacy “guaranteed”.
“Due to the sensitive nature of STI-related data, Australians have frequently reported privacy and confidentially concerns as one of the main barriers to STI testing and treatment,” Dr Tang said. Associate Professor Amy Mullens said the app would offer “real-time nudges”, to encourage timely treatment because “reducing the barriers to testing is so important”.
