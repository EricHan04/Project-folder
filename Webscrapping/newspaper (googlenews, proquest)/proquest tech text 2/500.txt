THE company chosen to ­develop the Entrepreneur and Innovation Centre (EIC) at the Lot Fourteen tech and start-up precinct has signed a 10-year lease for a $20m innovation hub within the centre.
Property private equity company Quintessential ­Equity has also worked with Cox Architecture and received approval to vary the design of the 16-storey, 41,000sq m EIC – the linchpin of Lot Fourteen, North Tce’s former Royal Adelaide Hospital site.
The building will incorporate a series of twisting and inter­connected floorplates, a faceted facade, public atrium and landscaped podium roof terrace.
The hub which will occupy the ground, and first floors will include an open area for events as well as dining venues.
Quintessential Equity executive chairman Shane Quinn said it would be “the centrepiece of the EIC” and an opportunity to attract and ­retain world-class talent.
“Embodying the office and workplace of the future, the EIC will be a powerful generator of jobs of the future – and this dedicated hub will be a place where ideas, research and entrepreneurship can thrive,” Mr Quinn said.
“The revised design is more functional and accessible as we focus on collaboration and the provision of a healthy and ­engaging work ­environment.” The Australian Space Agency, Australian Space Discovery Centre and Mission Control and Australian Institute for Machine Learning are already based at Lot Fourteen, and Amazon plans to establish an office on the site.
The federal government has committed up to $20m for the hub through the Adelaide City Deal, a 10-year agreement ­between the federal and state governments and the City of Adelaide.
Premier Steven Marshall said the hub would create “hundreds of jobs for decades to come”. Construction on the $400m EIC is scheduled to start mid-next year.
