Investors fled tech firm ResApp Health after it failed to meet a takeover performance target SHARES in digital health company ResApp slumped 28.6 per cent to 12.5c on Tuesday after a study into its technology produced disappointing results. The company has developed a smartphone app that aims to diagnose Covid-19 by listening to the sound of a cough. In a study it failed to reach the sensitivity thresholds required to deliver a bonanza for shareholders under a proposed takeover from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. As a result, Pfizer’s takeover offer will remain at 14.6c a share, or $127m – the lower end of an independent expert’s valuation into ResApp. If the app had passed the test, investors would have received 20.7c a share.
