SAMSUNG has launched a range of robots that would help people at home manage their health, track their sleep and call for help if you have a fall.
The Samsung Bot Care takes the form of a white robot on wheels. The tech giant told the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that its move into robotics came about because of a desire to use artificial intelligence to target societal challenges.
By placing your finger on the robot it can read your blood pressure and heart rate in a matter of seconds and tell you whether it is normal or not.
The robot, which would be especially helpful for the elderly or those with chronic health issues, also tracks your daily medication intake, your sleep patterns, and can call Triple-0 if it detects that you have fallen in your home and cannot get up.
In addition, your family can check in on your wellbeing even if they are far away.PAGE 23: GADGET SHOW TIME
