UNIVERSITY students will be able to extend their study for 12 months and receive $11,000 to go towards building their own start-up, under a move set to be rolled out by the Albanese government.
A total of 2000 students will be able to access the lump sum payment, which has been described as “relatively interest-free”, forming part of the student’s HECS debt.
Start-up Year, to begin next year, will see funding provided to students who successfully pitch and enter their home university’s accelerator or incubator program, of which there are about 100 nationwide.
Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic told a group of students and start-up founder at the University of Technology Sydney’s Broadway on Thursday: “Creating your own firm is a really important initiative and the country values it, and certainly this new government values it,” he said. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said financial barriers often limited the nation’s ability to grow new ideas. “We are worse off for that,” she said.
