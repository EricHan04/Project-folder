NEIGHBOURS star Sharon Johal is saying farewell to Ramsay Street this week – except she’s not.
While her character, Dipi, is leaving, Sharon’s sticking around behind the scenes.
She’s been invited to become a director on the long-running soap. “It was a shock because I feel I am completely under-qualified and they don’t just ask anybody,” says Sharon, who has been shadowing one of the long-running soap’s directors, Tenika Smith. Sharon will also be writing for Neighbours in the future.
Which begs the question: What if she were asked to pen Dipi’s return to Erinsborough?
“Dipi and her husband Shane (played by Nicholas Coghlan) would have outgrown each other and would be divorced,” Sharon says. “Dipi would come back with her own storyline and do what she wants.” Sharon says she would love Dipi to pursue her passions of musical theatre and acting.
“It would be a ‘Stella Got Her Groove Back’ (storyline) and Dipi would not feel guilty about it,” she says. “She would be owning her space.” Regardless of whether she ever plays Dipi again, Sharon’s fans will be pleased to know they haven’t seen the last of her in dramatic roles.
“I’m not quitting acting,” Sharon says.
“I’m doing it in addition (to writing and directing).
“I have been auditioning for different things – not just in Australia – but also for US productions.” Passionate about representing minorities, Sharon plans to eventually start up her own production company.
“Last year made us ask ourselves ‘what do we really want in life?’,” she says, adding: “I never wanted to be defined by one role.” WATCH:NEIGHBOURS, WEEKNIGHTS, 6.30PM, 10PEACH
