When Ferdi Alici founded Ouchhh about a decade ago, artificial intelligence and art were not as acquainted as they are now.
The earliest suggestions of AI came in the form of problem solving computers like the ones British mathematician Alan Turing proposed in his 1950 research paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which inspired Alici to begin creating AI-inspired artwork.
During World War II, Turing’s computer cracked the German Enigma machine codes. In 1996, world champion chess player Garry Kasparov played against an IBM computer named Deep Blue, narrowly beating it.
In 1997, after its technology was improved, Deep Blue defeated Kasparov during the pair’s rematch.
This was seen as a huge step forward for self-thinking machines. But artists like Alici have taken the problem solving technology and used it to create art far from traditional Renaissance paintings, and not without controversy.
Critics of AI-created artworks say the machines behind the art cannot replicate the empathy of human artists.
Despite this, the world’s first “robot artist”, Ai-Da, was created to attempt just that.
In 2020, Ai-Da presented a TEDx talk on the intersection of art and AI, arguing that machines benefit from being a step further removed from their subjects than humans.
Last month, a portrait was painted by Ai-Da of Queen Elizabeth II to mark her platinum jubilee. An art critic labelled the painting “cynical”, although it showed just how far AI has come since Turing’s World War II computer.
