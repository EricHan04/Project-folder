TECHNOLOGY A MASSIVE hike in wages for skilled software developers and cybersecurity engineers is putting local start-ups under strain, with several executives warning they are unable to compete for talent.
Wage increases are being driven by Australia’s borders still being closed to non-residents, combined with heightened demand for cybersecurity services during Covid.
Start-up founders are reporting that wages have increased so much that they are now unable to compete for talent against well-funded foreign giants, and the strain threatens to slow the early lead of the nascent local cybersecurity sector. Some reports are suggesting wages have increased by more than 30 per cent in just 12 months.
Cyber security executives said increased demand for skilled developers is pushing wages up to the point that local companies are having to rethink growth plans, as start-ups are outbid by well-funded international digital giants such as Amazon and Accenture. Paul McCarty (pictured), the boss of local start-up SecureStack, said some of the big tech players were offering staff remuneration of more than $300,000 a year. “One of my engineers was lured away even though he loves working for us. I told him I would counter – until I saw the offer, and then realised I simply couldn’t,” Mr McCarty said.
