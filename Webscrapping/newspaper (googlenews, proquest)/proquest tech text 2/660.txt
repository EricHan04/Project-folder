SOUTH Australian pilot Barrie Rogers was enjoying a well-earned rest on Saturday night after the first leg of his record-breaking attempt to fly 1150km in an electric aircraft.
He is hoping to smash the world endurance record of 750km set in Germany in 2020, in his Pipistrel Alpha Electro plane, which has a flight time range of about an hour. The managing director of Eyre to There Aviation, a start-up promoting electric aircraft, undertook SA’s first ever electric flight, also in 2020.
Mr Rogers, who set off from Parafield Airport early on Saturday, plans to take seven days to complete his trek around SA, supported by a team of pilots and ground crew, carrying recharging equipment.
“The world record we’re seeking to break is basically an endurance record to push the durability and reliability of the aircraft,” Mr Rodgers said. “We’re also hoping to break a couple of other records including fastest point-to-point single flight and fastest climb rate.” He plans to also investigate suitable airfields for the introduction of electric aircraft charging infrastructure.
