AN Adelaide mum has warned buyers to beware after purchasing a second-hand vehicle in “good condition” from NSW only to discover it was filled with mould.
Amanda* is now disputing the purchase, but buyers are being warned to beware as thousands of flood-damaged cars are flogged on the market.
Looking to upgrade her vehicle to accommodate her nine-month-old baby, Amanda purchased a 2015 Honda HR-V Wagon from online auction house Grays Auctions earlier this month.
A report provided by Grays described the condition of the vehicle’s interior and exterior as “good” but, when the car arrived at a Wingfield depot, she found the interior covered in mould, believed to be from flooding earlier this year.
“When I opened the door I thought, ‘it stinks like damp’,” Amanda said. “The whole car was saturated and there was mould on the seatbelts, on the interior roof, on the leather seats and all through the boot. It was absolutely disgusting.” Support worker Amanda said an independent assessor in Clovelly Park told her the car “should have been written off”. In the sale documents, Grays Online said the vehicle inspection was “based on walk-around and start-up only and is the opinion of the booking-in officer” and that the description is “a guide only as vehicle may have unsighted damaged/issues”.
It recommended a full inspection prior to purchase.
Amanda is now seeking a refund. Grays Online has been contacted for comment. *Amanda is not her real name
