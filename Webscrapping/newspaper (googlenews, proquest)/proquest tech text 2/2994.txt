A SYDNEY lawyer has suffered a backlash – because he shares the same name as a lawyer who encouraged civil unrest in Victoria by telling people not to wear masks.
Nathan Buckley, not the Collingwood AFL coach but director of Optic Lawyers in Sydney, said Nathan ­Andrew Buckley from G&B Lawyers had affected his business. The latter made headlines for posting “free legal advice” urging Victorians not to wear mandated masks and running crowd-funding campaigns to contest vaccination laws.
“I eventually had to shut down my firm website for about two weeks as a pre-emptive measure to avoid negative reviews on Google,” Mr Buckley said. “My firm’s office phone was off for about a week... .” He did not share the other Mr Buckley’s views. “What he has done has taken a huge toll on me, my family and my firm,” he said. “He is doing everything I am against.” Mr Buckley from G&B Lawyers declined to comment.
