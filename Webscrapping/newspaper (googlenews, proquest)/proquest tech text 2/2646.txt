First preference applications to Flinders University dropped 7.6 per cent to 5274, yet it has made slightly more undergraduate offers this year.
Deputy vice-chancellor (students) Clare Pollock said the institution was focusing courses on “key areas of emerging employment demand” including artificial intelligence and cyber security.
“The university is gearing up for the completion of the Darlington upgrade, the opening of the new Flinders Link rail connection, and start of work on the new Flinders Village precinct at Bedford Park this year, which will surround the train station with health, research, retail and accommodation opportunities,” she said.
UniSA acting vice-chancellor Simon Beecham said: “We’ve had steady interest in our study options this year, which reflects positively on the careful work we do to innovate and develop degrees in consultation with industry and the professions.”

MUSICAL MATES RALLY AROUND APRIL

In most university degrees, there’s a different crowd of students in each subject you take.
But in a course like Adelaide University’s Bachelor of Music Theatre, close bonds are formed between a small cohort who work with each other day in, day out.
That second family is helping April Pullen get through the disaster of losing her Mt Torrens home to the Cudlee Creek bushfire.
“Everyone in my course has been so lovely. Everyone’s support has been absolutely amazing,” she says.
When the fire struck on December 20, April was volunteering for the university, filming for a live social media promotion on Snapchat related to the December round of uni offers released that day.
She says it was a welcome distraction from what was unfolding in the Hills, where thankfully all her animals survived.
April, 20, would have headed to uni interstate last year to pursue her performing arts ambitions, if not for the launch of the new music theatre course here.
It’s five days a week of ballet, tap and jazz, acting classes, private singing lessons and ensemble singing.
Last year it culminated in a production of musical Spring Awakening to packed houses at the Festival Centre’s Space Theatre, with April in the role of a school teacher in the controversial coming-of-age story.
“It was amazing getting to perform in there,” she says.

This year April, who took up ballet when she was just four and performed in her first Fringe show while in Year 9, is looking forward to the students having their own show in the Adelaide Cabaret Festival.
They will also provide choral backing for the festival’s Do You Hear The People Sing: A Concert Spectacular, showcasing the partnership of composer and lyricist duo Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg – think Les Miserables and Miss Saigon.
April, who works on weekends in the cafe at the Big Rocking Horse in Gumeracha, hopes that a student showcase at the end of her third year at uni will lead to her finding an agent.
She’ll then move interstate to audition for “absolutely everything” she can in the professional theatre world.

ANTHONY GETS HIS GAME ON

Anthony Robinson says he “traded in my toolbelt for the pencil case”.
Now the former sparky is well on the way to launching his own video game company.
In 2016 he left his electrician job to take up a degree in Creative Arts (Visual Effects and Entertainment Design).
“I made the jump and never looked back since. It was a huge risk. Great risk, great reward, I guess,” he says.
The Flinders University course is run in collaboration with CDW Studios on the fourth floor of the Myer Centre in Rundle Mall, where Anthony, 28, has done most of his studying.
Classes include character, environment, and 3D design.
“It’s amazing up there. We are taught by industry professionals,” he says.
“They are really teaching the mentality of the industry as well as the skills.”
Anthony intends to “hit two birds with one stone” by focusing his honours year on how best to create his own studio.
He’s already got business and programming partners on board for the venture, and is constantly at work on the game that will launch the studio, a side-scrolling, Japanese-style role-player called Tinker and Spell.
“This year the goal is to have a fully-fledged studio,” he says.
“I’ve been very busy in regards to making this a reality.
“The potential of this (industry) is astronomical. I want to see how far I can push it. If you can create jobs you can contribute to society.”

Anthony spent the second half of last year making the most of an “insane opportunity” to work as a storyboard artist for the Mortal Kombat movie filmed in Adelaide.
That meant reading scripts, liaising with the director, and then frantically producing “shot by shot” drawings showing how scenes would play out.
But his passion is for video games, which is why he takes his study very seriously, putting in 50-hour weeks and burning the midnight oil.
“When you are at uni, you make of it what you will,” he says.
“I’m working on this as if it’s my job. It’s a fun job.”

FRANKE’S ENGINEERING HER OWN SUCCESS
Franke Agenbag 20, is studying Electrical and Mechatronic Engineering at UniSA. Picture: Tricia Watkinson
Uni is so busy for Franke Agenbag that she views her paid work as a bit of a social break.
Living in the Barossa Valley at Stockwell, and studying electrical and mechatronic engineering at UniSA’s Mawson Lakes campus, she has an hour’s travel each way, each day.
“I think I must love my degree to do that every day,” she says.
As well as her classes, she volunteers for UniSA’s STEM Girls program, which introduces Years 10 and 11 students to science careers through uni and industry tours and speeches in schools.
A former participant in the program herself when she was at Gawler and District College B-12, she says it’s important to reach girls at an “impressionable age” before they’ve picked their Year 12 subjects.
When Franke’s not at uni, she’s working 20 hours a week as a bar manager at a gin distillery in Nuriootpa, which she says is a “very social” job.
And when she’s not at work, she’s volunteering with Zonta International’s Gawler Branch, raising funds for birthing kits for women in developing countries, among other causes such as family violence and females in STEM.
This year she’ll be even busier, spending two days a week plus all her uni holidays on a work placement with the federal Defence Science and Technology agency, focused on a nano-satellite project.
“Things just sort of fall into place as long as you don’t double book yourself,” she says.
“Try to find a balance that works for you. Uni is very flexible and you can adjust it to suit your lifestyle.”
When she started uni, Franke, 20, won a scholarship for being the student starting at UniSA with the best Year 12 physics score the previous year.
Her dad is an electrical engineer and she reckons her similar degree choice has been a smart move.
“I’ll always have job security in this field,” she says.
“I’m definitely most interested in the space sector.”
Her family emigrated from South Africa when she was seven, and she is thankful for the much safer upbringing she enjoyed in South Australia, and the greater opportunities here.
