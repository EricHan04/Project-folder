We review the latest wireless earbuds – here are the top performers
Nuheara IQbuds2 Max These advanced earbuds can be used like hearing aids $499, nuheara.com PROS Personalised sound profile Can be used in noisy pubs Will deliver audio from the TV via an app CONS High price Big in the ears Charge with old micro USB connection These earbuds from a Perth-based start-up are unique because they’re not just about playing music: they can actually help those with mild hearing loss who don’t yet need hearing aids. They personalise audio for the wearer through an app and can magnify voices near you so you can hear them among the din.

BETTER SOUND Apple AirPods 3 The oddball design that got us all wearing earbuds just got smaller and a bit smarter $279, apple.com/au PROS Shorter stem Better sound, stronger bass Spatial Audio for select songs CONS No noise cancellation New design doesn’t suit all ears Spatial Audio requires subscription The strange but strangely effective design of Apple’s earbuds has been tweaked in their third edition. The white, wireless gadgets are smaller, with a shorter stem, and a redesigned main body that will be slightly more secure in some ears (though not all). They are water-resistant, feature an Adaptive EQ and produce solid bass.

GOOD FIT NuraTrue They look more like ear buttons than earbuds but these Aussie inventions personalise your audio $300, nuraphone.com PROS Creates a personalised audio profile Comfortable and secure design Touch buttons can be customised CONS Minimal noise cancellation Not designed for high-res formats Long charging time These Australian earbuds have two big advantages: a button-shaped design that is surprisingly comfortable, and a personalised sound profile for the wearer. When you put these buds in your ears, a demanding digital voice guides you to create a personalised audio set-up based on what frequencies you can hear (the company was created by two doctors). The result is a detailed sound that is different for each wearer. There are also customised tap controls for music playback and social mode (to hear the outside world), decent if not industry-standard noise cancellation and sweat resistance.

They are water and sweat resistant, connect to phones quickly and adapt to the sound around them.
