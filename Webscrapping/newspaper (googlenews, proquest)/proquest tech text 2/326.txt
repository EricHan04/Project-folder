The AmphiTheatre, Black Box Theatres @ Adelaide Botanic Garden and Watch From Home
Until March 12
Like the white rhino, the artist seems perilously close to extinction these days.
This production by Adelaide’s Motus Collective is a conceit, to be sure, but not an undeserving one.
The threatened species is depicted by a many-fringed beast (I name it a Sia-saurus) emerging from the depths of the amphitheatre in the Botanic Gardens.
A promising start, that, but the movement veers quickly and at length towards the mundane, with overlong unison sequences, time and time again.
An amusing duet offers some relief, but as the piece moves towards its predictable end – the return of the Siasaurus – the unisons start up again.
White Rhino is a good idea, but falters in the execution.
