A NEW smart-technology collar can now automatically treat dogs for tapeworms. Researchers from the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Tropical Diseases in Tibet trialled the battery-powered collars, which automatically treated dogs for Echinococcus, or tapeworm, for a year. Compared with districts where the treatment was given manually, researchers found the risk of worms, which cause vomiting and diarrhoea, was significantly decreased in the regions trialling the collar.
