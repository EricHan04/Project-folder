GEELONG could soon attract major investment from the United States with Consul General Kathleen Lively making her first visit to the region.
Ms Lively, who was appointed as the US Consul General in Melbourne in August, chose Geelong as her first trip with the hopes of strengthening the region’s ties with the United States.
“My main role is to help support and advance US alliances as well as help American citizens that happen to be here,” she said.
“In terms of building relationships, we are looking at important issues such as trade, economy, national security and climate change.” Victoria’s consular district also includes Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, with Geelong becoming the initial focus outside of Melbourne.
“Geelong is a growing area, and it is important to the state of Victoria and frankly to Australia,” she said.
“It is pretty clear there is a lot of opportunities and growth here.” During the Thursday visit, Ms Lively met with key stakeholders including G21, Deakin University and the City of Greater Geelong Mayor Stephanie Asher and Deputy Mayor Trent Sullivan.
“We talked about opportunities that might exist with US investment in renewable energy,” she said.
“Geelong has a strong history of manufacturing and while the car industry has declined, this new focus on electric vehicles is a real opportunity. There is a lot of ways to strengthen ties.” A Deakin University spokesman said campus leaders were delighted to welcome Ms Lively to the Waurn Ponds campus on Thursday.
“The visit included a tour of the Institute for Intelligent Systems ­Research and Innovation (IISRI) and a presentation on the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2),” he said. “Conversations focused on work being undertaken at Deakin in areas of national priority and relevant to the Australia-US relationship, including clean energy and battery technologies, commitments to carbon neutrality, defence and cyber security.”
