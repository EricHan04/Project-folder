TWO Adelaide blockchain start-ups have shared a $100,000 prize as part of the State Government’s inaugural Blockchain Innovation Challenge.
David Travers and Jeff Grosset from the Clare Valley Wine & Grape Association were awarded $50,000 to progress their innovative screwcap, which combines QR code technology and blockchain to confirm the authenticity of a bottle of wine.
The remaining $50,000 went to Wright Technologies, which has used blockchain technology to develop Seraph – a registration and real-time tracking system for drones, which improves air space safety and security.
The two start-ups beat eight other challengers as part of a pitch event at the ADC Global Blockchain Summit in Adelaide this week. Mr Travers and Mr Grosset have lodged a provisional patent of their idea and plan to use the prize money to finalise a proof of concept.
Mr Grosset, who played a leading role in the introduction of the screwcap 20 years ago, said blockchain technology could tackle the rising problem of counterfeit wine sales, as well as deliver potential logisitics savings across the wine supply chain.
“We’ve taken on the challenge to ensure that people can continue to rely on the provenance and authenticity of Australian wine,” he said.
Wright Technologies chief executive Kosta Canatselis said the prizemoney would go towards developing a “real-world prototype”.“We plan on spending the investment on research and development, more specifically on technology validation working to a real-world pilot through partner-ships we’ve established,” he said. “We’re aiming to be able to demonstrate the ability to safely and securely integrate drones into regulated airspace and ensure we can trust drones to be used for innovative applications across government and industry.”
