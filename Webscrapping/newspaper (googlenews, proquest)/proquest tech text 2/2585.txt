SENIOR SA Health officials “preferred” security cameras that cost 10 times more than those offered by a firm amid claims of public sector conflict of interest, an MP claims.
SA Best MLC Frank Pangallo yesterday raised “grave concerns” in State Parliament’s Upper House about the “conduct and ability” of the SA Health team overseeing a trial of CCTV in nursing homes.
Months after the State Government announced the Australian-first $500,000 pilot with Care Protect, the firm quit amid claims of “excessive due diligence”, the MP said.
Using Parliamentary privilege, he claimed SA Health’s chief digital health officer, Bret Morris and the agency’s security adviser Chad Khoury preferred cameras that cost $1000 compared to the firm’s $100 pitch over “security concerns”.An SA Health spokeswoman said in a statement last night: “We have looked into the allegations and no conflicts of interest have been found. All public sector employees are bound by a code of ethics.”
