ENTREPRENEURS TWO best friends who were stood down from their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic have bounced back in style.
Pam Yip and Jenny Le have broken Australia’s record for the highest number of expressions of interest (EOIs) for a crowd-funding campaign for their DIY bubble tea business.
Bubble Tea Club had notched up nearly 3000 pledged investors ahead its launch on the Birchal platform on Wednesday.
The company was started by Melbourne friends Ms Yip, a marketer and Ms Le, an optometrist, amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year.
Their co-founders were Justin Huang, Tim Huang and Yi Ong.
The start-up has quickly overtaken the two previous record holders, female-only ridesharing service Shebah (2466 EOIs) and ocean waste collection start-up SEABIN (2235 EOIs).
Bubble Tea Club has become a $2m company within 12 months, thanks to their idea of selling DIY at-home Bubble Tea making kits, which have been sold to more than 30,000 customers.
Their bubble tea, which is a popular flavoured milk tea drink served with different types of chewy tapioca balls, starts at $1.75 per serve, compared to the usual $7 to $9 when sold at a store.
“To think, this all started in lockdown last year after losing our jobs, and now Bubble Tea Club is responsible for creating jobs for 30 people,“ Ms Yip said.
With the average EOI investment being $3582, Birchal is predicting Bubble Tea Club could comfortably sell $4.7m in shares – yet only $2m in equity is being released in this raise. Ms Yip said Bubble Tea Club plans to use funds raised to grow the Australian market, expand internationally, finalising R&D, and international expansion into US and Canada, and eventually the UK.
