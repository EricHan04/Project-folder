MYRIOTA, an Adelaide space start-up, has inked a deal with the Australian Space Agency.
The company, which is based at Lot Fourteen, has invented a way to link customers into the Internet of Things, which uses nanosatellites to connect to objects.
For example, a farmer can use sensors on stock that send data to nanosatellites. Then the farmer can download information to see where the stock are, and even how healthy they are.
The Internet of Things is credited with the ability to transform a range of industries.
The Space Agency will announce today that it has signed a “statement of strategic intent and co-operation” with Myriota. It recently announced a similar agreement with aerospace giant Airbus.
Agency deputy head Anthony Murfett said the statement “embodies the trans-formation we are witnessing in the space industry, both in Australia and around the world”.
“It demonstrates that businesses of all sizes can make a significant contribution to Australia’s space industry,” Mr Murfett said. “ (Myriota’s) technology is used to solve issues … including water and agricultural management in regional Australia.” The Adelaide-based Agency turned one on July 1. Its goal is to triple the industry to $12 billion by 2030, and to create 20,000 new jobs.
Myriota chief executive officer and co-founder Alex Grant said the company planned to add 25 satellites to its fleet, and expand its team.“We’re passionate about fostering a diverse STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) workforce,” Dr Grant said. “Our strategy has a particular focus on developing initiatives that profile the achievements of female tech leaders, while investing in Women in STEM programs to creating a thriving female workforce.”
