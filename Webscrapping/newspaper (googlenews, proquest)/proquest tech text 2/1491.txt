Veteran cricket teams from around Australia and New Zealand have learned they will not be able to attend the 2021 Veterans Cricket Australia Championships for over-50s in Adelaide in November.
The popular event, which would have supported the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and raised awareness of the men's health issue, has been cancelled due to COVID-19.
Functions were due to be held at the Adelaide Oval from November 13-18 and some 20 matches a day played at local cricket grounds.
In Australia each year, nearly 17,000 men are diagnosed with, and 3000 men will die from, prostate cancer.
Sports commentator and long-term foundation supporter Peter Walsh had come on board as an ambassador for the event, having been through prostate cancer himself.
"Being diagnosed with any type of cancer can be such a huge shock," he said.
