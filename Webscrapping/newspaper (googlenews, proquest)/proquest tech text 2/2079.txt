South Australia's premier AgTech conference AdvanceAg has been rescheduled for October in Adelaide after being postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The conference, which brings together farmers, new technology, businesses, developers, researchers and innovators, has locked in more than 30 exhibitors and more than 25 speakers.
It will now take place on October 17 and 18 at the Adelaide Convention Centre.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham said the AdvanceAg event would adhere to all COVID-19 protocols in the state.
He said the state government had worked with keynote speakers and other stakeholders who were due to come from overseas, interstate and across the regions, to ensure it could proceed.
This includes Peter Wren-Hilton from AgriTech New Zealand, who will present 'From NZ to SA: Why AgTech is not just another buzzword', plus Myriota co-founder and chief executive officer Dr Alex Grant speaking about satellite technology lifting agriculture.
"AdvanceAg will feature some of the brightest minds in the world of agricultural technology demonstrating how new innovations can help solve real-world problems," Mr Basham said.
"The conference will include thought-provoking panel sessions and exciting concurrent speakers for a range of sectors including meat, livestock and dairy, grains and broadacre, horticulture, and viticulture."
The conference will also look at the latest AgTech topics across monitoring, sensors and imagery, automation, connectivity, IOT and data use, and software.
