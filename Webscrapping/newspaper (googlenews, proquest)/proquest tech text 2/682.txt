TECHNOLOGY AUSTRALIAN firm Gilmour Space Technologies is on target to launch its first rocket into orbit this year.
The company recently had a successful 110-kilonewton (25,000 pound) test fire of the most powerful rocket engine ever developed in Australia.
The 75-second test was a major milestone for the company which hopes over the next five years to develop rockets capable of launching satellites and payloads weighing 300kg to 4000kg into low earth and other orbits.
“It was a successful test,” said CEO Adam Gilmour who founded the company with his brother James in 2013. “Our team will be moving on to the final engine qualification campaign next month.” He said the test was also a demonstration of Australia’s first sovereign launch capability.
“It is no small thing to say that we’ve developed Australia’s largest rocket engine; and that it could have significant flow-on benefits for the commercial, civil and defence space sectors,” Mr Gilmour said.
The company, which launched its first hybrid rocket in 2016, has so far raised $87m from investors, making the start-up one of Australia’s leading space companies.
James Gilmour, head of launch operations, said Gilmour Space now employs 111 staff and expects to hit the 150 target by the middle of this year. He said with strategic government support, staff numbers could double by 2023.
“Watching a rocket leaving the earth is incredible and I want every Australian to know what we are doing, get excited, and know that no dream is too big if they work for it,” James Gilmour said. If the company gets all relevant state and federal approvals, it hopes to launch its Eris orbital rocket from Queensland later this year.
