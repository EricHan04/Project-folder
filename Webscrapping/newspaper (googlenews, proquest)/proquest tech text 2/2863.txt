AUSTRALIA’S equity crowd funding industry has defied what’s typically the quietest period of the year, growing by 89 per cent year-on-year in the latest quarter.
Equity crowd funding volumes exceeded $10m for the three months to March 31, representing 89 per cent growth – compared to a 57 per cent decline for broader equity capital markets – according to data from crowd funding platform Birchal.
Amid what’s traditionally a sluggish period for the industry, Gold Coast brewer Black Hops had one of the standout crowdsourced funding (CSF) campaigns, raising $2.2m. “The CSF industry continues to go from strength to strength,” Birchal managing director Matt Vitale said. “Total funding volumes for the financial year to date exceed $57m across 65 successful CSF offers, about double the total funding volume of $28.4m at this time last year.”
