NO MATTER how good you get at virtual car racing, a bot can do it better, according to Sony researchers.
They developed an artificial intelligence agent that can play Gran Turismo, the virtual car racing game.
The AI is able to race against other vehicles, factoring in the strategy necessary to pass other vehicles, choose new lines when blocked by ­opponents and avoid incurring penalties for poor racing ­etiquette. The AI beat four of the world’s best human Gran Turismo drivers.
