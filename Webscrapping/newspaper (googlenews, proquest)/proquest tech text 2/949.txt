SOUTH Australian start-ups are the most likely to survive in Australia, according to a new report.
The Xero’s Boss Insights 2020 analysis says new businesses in the Barossa Valley and Yorke Peninsula have the best survival rate nationally.
There is a downside, however, with new business growth in greater Adelaide slower than other Australian cities.
From 2009 to 2018, there were 9000 new businesses in greater Adelaide, representing an increase of 8 per cent – lower than the national average of 13 per cent.
Nationally, the picture is upbeat with around 2.2 million business owners now operating in Australia, a spike of 700,000 since 1991.
Forestville bakery owner Tim Salmon opened Cherry Darlings, which specialises in vegan products, in May 2014. It initially was a two-person outfit and now has eight staff.
Adelaide can be a very good environment for start-ups he said, but to get ahead it is essential to differentiate.
“Niche is always good – you need to be better, cheaper or different to succeed,” Mr Salmon said.
“I try and do all three. I am a body piercer by trade, so this was a side hobby to start with.
“I realised people wanted an out-of-the-box product.” Mr Salmon, who has been a vegan for 20 years, said it had always been his desire to make quality products that matched his cleaner, greener, ethos.
“Our food is a treat; it still has fats and sugars but they are not negative fats,” he said.
A clever approach to location has been fundamental, too.
“We operate from a suburb, and people go out of their way to come to us, so we don’t need a shopfront on a high street,” Mr Salmon said.
An extension to the premises has recently happened, while an additional outlet is on the cards shortly.Demographer and report author Bernard Salt said there was a relentless energy and determination by Australians to build a business and thrive.
