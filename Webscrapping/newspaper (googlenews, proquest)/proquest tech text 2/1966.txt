ANDREW “Twiggy” Forrest’s charity has launched its most daring goal yet – the ability, by 2025, for Australia to extinguish all dangerous bushfires in an hour.
The mining magnate’s Minderoo Foundation will work with government, industry and the research sector to investigate new ways to bolster the nation’s firefighting ability as part of its new fire and flood resilience initiative.
Minderoo has joined forces with 47 partners, including big ASX-listed companies. Its disaster resilience blueprint aims for Australia to have the ability to stop dangerous fires in their tracks.
Adrian Turner, pictured, has been recruited to lead Minderoo’s bushfire mission. He likened its task to former US president John F. Kennedy’s challenge to put humans on the moon, which seemed impossible, but was achieved.
“What we’re doing is applying the latest technology that’s used in other fields and applying it to firefighting,” he said.
“If we’re successful, we’ll be able to stop fires … within an hour.” Mr Turner said work was already under way, including one project with the NSW Government using satellite images from last summer’s fires.
“We funded a competition, our teams were given real satellite imagery from the bushfires and their job was to come up with new artificial intelligence techniques to be able to remotely monitor fuel load and figure out moisture content in landscapes to predict ignition points and the spread,” Mr Turner said. Other projects Minderoo will invest in will look at how to respond more quickly to fires.
