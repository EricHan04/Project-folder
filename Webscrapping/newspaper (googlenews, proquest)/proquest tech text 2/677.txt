The flagship spin reel in the Daiwa light tackle range elevates reel design to a new level with the release of the 22 Exist.
A beacon of design possibility and performance since the original Exist was released in 2006, the 22 model introduces new designs and technologies to deliver anglers their most advanced light tackle Daiwa spin reel to date.
The foundation of the 22 Exist’s design is Daiwa’s new Airdrive Design – a four-pillar design concept that reduces weight and enhances rotational smoothness and responsiveness to create a reel that is next level in both form and function. The new Airdrive Rotor and Airdrive Airbail combine to reduce weight at the top of the reel, improving rotational smoothness and start up speed, and minimising rotational resistance and inertia. These design benefits are further enhanced by the Exist’s new weight-saving Airdrive Spool. A leap forward in Daiwa light tackle spin reel design, Daiwa’s Airdrive Design concept combines with proven Daiwa technologies including Monocoque Body, Magseal, Tough Digigear, ATD and Twistbuster, to deliver anglers their most advanced Exist reel ever.
