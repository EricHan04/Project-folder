COMMUNITY station Radio Adelaide has issued a “call to action” to decide on its future after its long-time manager Chris Leese quit.
Mr Leese, who has been with the station for most of its 47 years, wrote to the station’s volunteers this week about his exit on March 6.
“It has been my honour to lead Radio Adelaide through the most turbulent and difficult period of its 47-year history,” Mr Leese said in his email.
“We have persevered as a community because of the enduring commitment and efforts of many volunteers like you and I am very grateful to you for the work you do every week to enrich Adelaide with local arts, music and ideas.
“We still face significant and urgent challenges, but I am very proud of what we have achieved and I know that, with the support it deserves, Radio Adelaide can prosper as a thriving, independent station.” Mr Leese and office manager Carol Atkinson, who resigned in December, had successfully led a crowd-funding campaign to raise $50,000 to rebuild Radio Adelaide as a dynamic, modern broadcaster.
He had previously said it was becoming increasingly difficult to find the revenue to keep the station – established as 5UV in 1972 – operational after Adelaide University parted ways with Radio Adelaide in July 2016. Board vice-president PJ Rose said members would meet on Monday to decide the station’s future.“Recent fires and floods have forced most of us to acknowledge that our natural environment has changed,” the letter to members said. “Economic climates have changed as well.” The station produces more than 120 hours of original, local content every week.
