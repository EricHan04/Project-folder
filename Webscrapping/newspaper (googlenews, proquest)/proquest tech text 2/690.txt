TECHNOLOGY FUELLED by blockbuster demand for employee engagement solutions, HR software start-up Culture Amp has leapt past its competition to become one of Australia’s most valuable tech companies.
The company has landed a $US100m ($135m) funding round, giving it an implied $2bn valuation. Culture Amp CEO and co-founder Didier Elzinga said that while his company was cashflow positive and had no need to raise extra funding, he could not say no to the opportunity for extra growth, particularly given the spurts in remote and distributed work thanks to the ongoing pandemic.
Culture Amp has grown its user base by 300 per cent in the past 12 months and will hire an additional 300 roles this year.
“The business is totally exploding,” Mr Elzinga said.
“We see this huge opportunity to really define this category of employee experience.” HR tech has not created many large companies to date, and has not received much backing from investors, according to Mr Elzinga, who said Melbourne-based Culture Amp was “streets ahead” of its competitors, both locally and abroad.
The company helps organisations modernise their approach to employee engagement and performance management, and its software platform is used by about 4000 organisations globally.
TDM Growth Partners and Sequoia Capital China led the $US100m Series F funding round, with participation from new investor Salesforce Ventures and a number of existing investors.
“We’re on track to smash $100m in revenue, as we said we would, and now we’re thinking about what it means to get to $500m in revenue,” Mr Elzinga said. “It wasn’t a particularly long or arduous fundraise, I’m happy to get back to building the business.”
