A SOUTH Australian start-up will develop complex jamming technology to detect and disable enemy explosives after securing a $5.3m federal government contract.
The deal will allow Thebarton company RFTEQ to further develop its “Complex Adaptive Threat Jammer Technology” with aims for the Australian Defence Force to soon use it on the battlefield. Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price said the technology was “Aussie ingenuity at its best”. The contract will create at least five new jobs.
