DIVORCING couples can sometimes argue for months and even years but a new online tool has cut the average resolution time to just seven days for property and 12 days for children.
About 1700 people have used the Federal Government’s artificial intelligence DIY divorce service amica.gov.au since it started in June.
The interactive online tool was developed with $3m from the government. From the end of this year, couples will be charged between $165 and $440 to use the service. The system can save up to $20,000 in average combined legal costs.
Amica has already had about 45,000 page views since its launch. Project chief Gabrielle Canny, from National Legal Aid, said even more users were expected because of COVID-19 pressures on relationships.
“There are almost 50,000 divorces each year in Australia and independent social research reveals 78 per cent of people say they would use an online service of this type,” she said.
“Amica offers a step-by-step approach to help separating couples reach amicable agreements and record them in plain language on a secure digital platform.
“It informs people about their options and encourages them to log on instead of ‘lawyering up’.” The system is recommended only for couples who are reasonably amicable and willing to communicate and negotiate online.
