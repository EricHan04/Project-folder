FORGET the traditional Melbourne Cup, The Everest or Cox Plate. The hottest thing in racing now has thousands of events on a virtual floating track daily and is streamed by millions of viewers around the world, all powered by the blockchain.
It has celebrities such as Mike Tyson and Paris Hilton as owners of virtual horses, which – just like physical thoroughbreds – are bred, bought and sold.
And it is all the work of an Australian start-up Zed Run, which in less than two years has its parent firm Virtually Human Studios quietly reaching the coveted $1bn “unicorn” valuation status.
Zed Run is a digital horse racing platform. The business marries old-fashioned horse racing buying, selling and breeding nous with cutting-edge blockchain technology which creates a digital ledger of transactions.
There are now more than 100,000 horses in the Zed Run ecosystem, and up to $20m is traded on the secondary horse market via the blockchain daily.
Zed Run achieved its biggest individual sale last week when a stallion called Breathless Edge was bought for $US420,590 ($562,598).
Races take place on Zed Run’s website and on streaming platform Twitch. There are 12 horses in each race, the outcome of which is decided by more than 10,000 different outcomes from the company’s algorithms.
Co-founder Rob Salha describes it as “blended reality”. “You‘re watching the screen, cheering, just like you would with a typical racehorse,” he said.
The old world and the new will come crashing together next week after the Victoria Racing Club, custodians of the Melbourne Cup carnival, clinched a deal for their famous Flemington racetrack to feature on Zed Run. VRC chairman Neil Wilson said the move would open up traditional horse racing to a different audience.
