AN Adelaide firm creating an app that combines outdoor exercise with cryptocurrency earnings has topped the list of Australia’s best start-ups.
StepN, which lets players buy virtual sneakers and earn money by logging their walks and runs, won the title after attracting more than $5m in seed funding following its launch in December 2021.
But the company recently revealed it made more than $122m in profit between May and June after attracting millions of users to its platform.
The crypto company, which has been described as Pokemon Go meets Strava, is the creation of Yawn Rong and Jerry Huang, who entered and won recognition for their concept in the worldwide Solana Ignition Hackathon.
Sequoia India vice-president Aakash Kapoor, who invested in the South Australian firm, called StepN a “category-defining Web3 app and NFT platform”.
“It marries the real world with a fun and accessible move-to-earn gameplay,” Mr Kapoor said. “We are excited by the game’s potential to create fitness habits while introducing users into the crypto world at the same time,” he said.
