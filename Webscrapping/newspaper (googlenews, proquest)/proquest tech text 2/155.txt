PERTH exploration start-up H2EX is tapping into the research expertise of Australia's national science agency as it steps up its bid to unearth “gold” hydrogen in South Australia.
The company is in a research agreement with the CSIRO in the search for naturally occurring hydrogen, after securing an exploration licence on the Eyre Peninsula.
H2EX said the CSIRO would undertake a “desktop study” of the licence area as a first step towards understanding the natural hydrogen system in the region.
Historical drilling records indicate hydrogen at up to 85 per cent purity could be in the region.
The potential for natural hydrogen in Australia was underlined in a research paper published by the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia last year.
Natural hydrogen deposits form through chemical reactions underground, with the most well-known process being the oxidation between water and iron sediments. Unlike “green” or “blue” hydrogen, which use energy and capital-intensive processes to extract hydrogen from water or natural gas, natural or “gold” hydrogen needs little processing and is potentially far cheaper and more energy-efficient to produce.
