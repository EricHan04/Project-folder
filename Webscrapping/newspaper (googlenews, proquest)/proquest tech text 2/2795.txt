EXCLUSIVE A NEW blueprint to transform Melbourne’s north and west — including a second Metro ­tunnel and an outer-northern ­suburbs hospital — is being launched to kickstart the post-pandemic economy.
A total of 66 major projects are detailed in the plan, which aims to create 300,000 jobs over the next two decades.
To be launched on Monday by former Victorian premiers Steve Bracks and John Brumby and Senate president Scott Ryan, the bipartisan strategy has the unprecedented backing of all 13 councils across an area that will be home to three million people by 2040.
It has been created as part of the commonwealth’s City Deals scheme — designed to accelerate growth and jobs in specific areas of need.
The biggest new initiative is a second Melbourne Metro tunnel, connecting the Mernda line across the city to Fishermans Bend and under Yarra River to Newport.
An outer-northern suburbs hospital near Beveridge and a food export hub in Epping are among other new projects.
Several other road and rail schemes and community developments already in the pipeline are also proposed to be fast-tracked.
One such major road is a 100km outer-metropolitan super-highway, linking the Hume Freeway in the north to the Princes Freeway southwest of Werribee. State and federal governments are already working on the business case.
With tens of thousands of people unemployed in Melbourne’s north and west as a result of the coronavirus, Mr Brumby said the City Deal identified shovel-ready “stimulus” projects for prioritisation and a longer-term recovery strategy.
Mr Bracks said the “compelling case” would be submitted to the federal government in order to become the 11th City Deal across the nation and the second in Victoria after Geelong.
“This … is a blueprint for the region to respond to the impacts of the pandemic,” he said.
“It has significant benefits for the whole of the Australian economy.” As one of Australia’s fastest-growing areas, Melbourne’s north and west will house one in 12 Australians — more than the whole of South Australia — within two decades. The blueprint also details how to attract investment around major infrastructure developments already locked in, including the Airport Rail Link, the new A-League stadium in Wyndham, and the $16 billion North East Link.
New jobs “hubs” would be created to entice private-sector cash to areas such as Sunshine, set to explode due to new airport rail and regional rail upgrades, and Beveridge, where massive freight and logistics centres will be built.
With Melbourne Airport, the Port of Melbourne, the national freight rail terminal, and the Hume Freeway all within the region, Senator Ryan said its economic importance was obvious. “For our nation to succeed, the north and west Melbourne region needs to succeed,” Senator Ryan said.
As part of the strategy, a new Melbourne Centre for Civil Construction at Werribee would train high-skilled workers for major projects.
Another key project is La Trobe University’s $5bn City of the Future, which would drive $3.5bn in economic activity in a decade.
The strategy also urges the Andrews government to start the western sections of its Suburban Rail Loop at the same time as its Cheltenham-Box Hill “stage one” — in 2022.
About 60 per cent of coronavirus cases in Victoria have been within north and west Melbourne, which already includes eight of the 10 most disadvantaged council areas.
Mr Brumby, who was the member for Broadmeadows and is now chancellor of La Trobe University, said: “You can’t really begin to think about Australia’s economic ­recovery until this area, the north and the west, are firing on all cylinders.
“So far, around 80,000 jobs have been lost in the north, with thousands more employees on reduced hours, and almost half of the businesses in the west have lost more than 25 per cent of their revenue compared to same period last year as a result of COVID-19.” Part of the City Deal plan would be to bring back manufacturing in the traditional working-class area. This would include the development of ­advanced technology-based work, as well as energy and waste reuse industries.

EAST WERRIBEE EMPLOYMENT PRECINCT Home to research organisations, medical facilities, advanced manufacturing and educational organisations. Has significant potential as a jobs, technology and education hub. Includes 775 hectares of land ready for mixed-use development. Will cater to more than half a million residents projected to be living in Wyndham council area by 2040.
MELBOURNE AIRPORT RAIL LINK Would connect international airport with a rail service for the first time. Trains run through Sunshine, which would be turned into a major rail hub with connections to regional rail lines as well as Suburban Rail Loop. A business case is being developed ahead of construction starting in 2022. Could take up to nine years to build.
BEVERIDGE FREIGHT TERMINAL About 1000 hectares of land has been identified for a new freight and logistics hub that would link in to an Inland Rail project. Provides massive jobs boost to the rapidly expanding community across northern metropolitan Melbourne. Strategically located to maximise links to the Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane rail line, Hume Freeway and proposed Outer Metropolitan Ring Road.
EPPING INNOVATION AND FOOD EXPORT HUB Next to Melbourne Wholesale Fruit, Vegetable and Flower Market is a 51-hectare site available to develop a 21st century food cluster. Would include manufacturing, distribution and research facilities, to take advantage of massive growth in food and beverage industry which is a competitive strength of region.
OUTER METROPOLITAN RING ROAD A 100km high-speed transport link for people and freight. Will create better connections to Melbourne Airport, Avalon Airport, Port of Geelong and proposed Beveridge Intermodal Freight Terminal and Western Intermodal Freight Precinct. A business case has been co-funded by state and federal governments.
WESTERN RAIL PLAN Fast, high capacity trains for rapidly growing west and regional cities, including two electrified metropolitan rail lines in Melton and Wyndham Vale. Boosts capacity between Sunshine and CBD to cater for faster and more frequent metropolitan and regional trains. Will be planned alongside Melbourne Airport Rail Link.
LA TROBE UNIVERSITY CITY OF THE FUTURE A $5bn redevelopment of land owned by the university to create 20,000 new jobs, education facilities for 40,000 students, housing for 12,000 people and $3.5bn in economic activity over the next decade. Involves short-to-medium term bus and light rail plan to mimic the Suburban Rail Loop route until that project is built.
SCIENCEWORKS REIMAGINED Scienceworks, which hosts around 505,000 visits a year, has potential to grow into state-of-the-art multimedia technology and education precinct of national significance. Concept includes upgraded and expanded museum, a science, technology and mathematics school, a university, a TAFE and industry partner.
MELBOURNE METRO 2 A second cross-city tunnel project that adds capacity to the Mernda, Hurstbridge and Werribee lines given huge population growth in those areas. Would link northern suburbs to Fishermans Bend and Newport, then through to Altona North and Sunshine using existing freight lines. Would pave the way for a Lalor to Wollert rail extension.
FOOTSCRAY HOSPITAL AND UNIVERSITY TOWN New health and education precinct that includes a $1.5bn, 504-bed public hospital, and creates 2000 on-going jobs. Aligns with Footscray University Town initiative between Victoria University and Maribyrnong City Council, to deliver a smart, creative and vibrant multicultural community.
