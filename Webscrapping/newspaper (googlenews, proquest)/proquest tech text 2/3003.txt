DIAMONDS coach Lisa Alexander says that Netball Australia couldn’t have punished Maria Folau for publicly supporting sacked Wallabies star husband Israel, but stresses the sport she represents is fiercely inclusive.
New Zealand and Adelaide Thunderbirds sharp-shooter Folau has come under fire for endorsing Israel’s crowd-funding efforts in his legal fight against Rugby Australia, who terminated his contract over his latest homophobic social media post claiming "hell awaits" gay people.
Netball Australia, Super Netball and the Thunderbirds determined Folau’s Instagram post had not breached their social media policy and she would therefore not be sanctioned. Australian netball legend Liz Ellis slammed the decision as “not good enough”.
Alexander was more diplomatic, saying her employer had little choice. “I just don’t think they can,” Alexander told The Advertiser.“That’s why Netball Australia really came out to say that they know that there is nothing there in the (contractual stipulations). And also that we do support inclusivity, we are absolutely for it.”
