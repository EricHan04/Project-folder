AUSTRALIAN Fashion Labels has been bought by a group of investors led by the state’s new chief entrepreneur, Andrew Nunn, who is determined to turn the business around and help create a sustainable fashion industry in South Australia.
Mr Nunn, pictured, who was anointed as the state’s chief entrepreneur earlier this month, said he wanted to lead by example, and if businesses such as Australian Fashion labels disappeared, the jobs and skills they had built up over years would go with them. He said staff would be at work on Monday, getting the next season’s designs out to market.
Mr Nunn said the initial plan would be to employ about 30 of the 57 staff made redundant when the bus-iness was placed in administration in January.
Founders Melanie and Dean Flintoft would continue to work with the company in some capacity, he said. It will be run by Sean Ebert, who Mr Nunn said had experience in business turnarounds and, in the initial stages, would focus on online sales. Gift vouchers will be honoured, and the company’s website will be live from today.
Staff will be given an ownership stake in the business in order to motivate them, but also in recognition of the creative and demanding work they did. The company’s brands include Finders Keepers, C/MEO Collective, Keepsake and The Fifth Label.
Buying the business was not just about the jobs saved, but also about preserving skills, Mr Nunn said. “They’ve done a great job building a brand,” he said. “They obviously had problems with COVID; they had problems with too much debt to service.
“Once you lose these skills sets, they’re very hard to get back. If I link it back to my role as chief entrepreneur, I want the state to be better, stronger, smarter, faster, all the things that it should be.” The group of investors will pay an undisclosed sum for the business. Terms have been negotiated with key suppliers, which will allow the company to start up quickly. PAGES 58-59: BUSINESS DAILY
