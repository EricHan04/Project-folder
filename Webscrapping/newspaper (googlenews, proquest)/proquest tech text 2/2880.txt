FOUR juvenile platypuses have been found in Kangaroo Island’s Flinders Chase National Park, raising hopes the species is recovering after the 2020 bushfires.
A team of researchers from Flinders University and the University of NSW surveyed the introduced population at Rocky River. National Parks and Wildlife Service Kangaroo Island conservation ecologist Heiri Klein said researchers found four juveniles – two males and two females – along with two male and female adults.
“The age of the juveniles mean they would have been born after the 2020 fires that affected the entire Rocky River catchment, which is great news for the recovering Kangaroo Island platypus population,” he said. But no platypuses were caught further upstream at the Platypus Waterholes or East Melrose Track, which was likely the result of dry conditions and the fires’ effects on habitat. The survey was supported by the state government and crowd-funding.
