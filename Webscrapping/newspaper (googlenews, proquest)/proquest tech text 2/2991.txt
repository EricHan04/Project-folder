ISRAEL Folau will likely be in the stands when Australia plays New Zealand today, after the sacked rugby star was spotted in Liverpool.
Folau has quietly travelled to the Netball World Cup, undoubtedly to support his wife, Silver Ferns shooter Maria.
The 30-year-old, currently in a legal battle with Rugby Australia following his contract termination over a social media post claiming “hell awaits” gay people, has kept a low profile in Liverpool, staying off social media.
But there’s every chance he’ll be courtside when Maria and New Zealand line up against the Diamonds.
Even before Folau arrived, the saga surrounding his religious views had bled into netball’s biggest event. Maria has come under fire for endorsing Israel’s crowd-funding efforts to help pay his legal fees and has declined to speak to the press all tournament.
Netball Australia, Super Netball and the Thunderbirds determined Folau’s Instagram post had not breached their social media policy and she therefore would not be sanctioned.
Australian netball legend Liz Ellis slammed the decision as “not good enough”, while Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander and others believe the situation is more complicated.The Silver Ferns have made it clear their priority is Maria’s wellbeing.
