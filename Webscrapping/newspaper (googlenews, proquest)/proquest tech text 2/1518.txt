MARKETS INVESTORS wiped $41bn off Australian shares as Covid worries spooked global markets.
In its worst day in two months, the ASX 200 share index closed down 128 points or 1.73 per cent at 7279.3 points.
The Aussie dollar also took a hit and was trading at US71.36c late Friday, after having fallen as much as 1 per cent in 24 hours.
Shares in artificial intelligence data services company Appen were the worst performer on the benchmark index, slumping 18.8 per cent to $9.45 after Macquarie downgraded to Underperform.
Travel stocks were also punished, with Flight Centre closing down 7.5 per cent to $17.14 and Qantas down 5.5 per cent to $5 after the UK suspended flights to South Africa and five other nations due to a new variant of Covid, known as B11529. A surge in Covid cases in Europe prompted a full lockdown in Austria.
Energy stocks also took a hammering, with Woodside Petroleum down 5.1 per cent to $21.60 as crude oil prices fell.
Retailers were lower despite the latest statistics showing that national spending increased 4.9 per cent to $31.1bn in October. EY chief economist Joanne Masters (pictured) said the figures were the latest sign that the economy was “roaring back”. Coles dropped 0.3 per cent to $18.01 and Woolworths fell 0.5 per cent to $40.31.
