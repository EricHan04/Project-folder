MEDICINAL cannabis start-up Cann Group has been given a major financing boost and says it can now build a production facility in Victoria.
The company said yesterday it had received credit approval from National Australia Bank for a $50m secured debt facility, with documentation expected to be complete within a month.
Cann Group will use the loan to complete the first stage of its production site near Mildura, with work expected to resume in February. The company has already spent about $53m on site works and a greenhouse and support building. The total cost of the first stage will be $112m.
Cann Group secured a Victorian Government development grant of $1.95m in July and the rest of the costs will be paid out of cash reserves. Product is slated to start being processed by March 2022.
The company says 130 new jobs will be created once the facility is commissioned but it will use specialist overseas contractors for the construction, and they have been cleared to arrive in Australia in the new year. Shares in Cann Group closed yesterday at 44c. “Securing the support of a tier-one bank is a strong validation of our growth plans,” chief executive Peter Crock said.
