ADELAIDE women’s health start-up Alyra Biotech is one of two South Australian projects to win a share of $17m in funding for 23 projects in round one from CUREator, the national biotech “incubator”.
The pharmaceutical company is developing intra-uterine products to treat conditions including pelvic pain in women.
Alyra Biotech founder Dr Susan Evans said the support came at a vital time as the company was moving to clinical trials later this year.
“We’re thrilled CUREator have seen the potential and importance of our research in helping women,” she said. The program has provided funding to support the clinical development of novel drug therapies as well as preclinical biomedical technologies.
