AN ADELAIDE start-up that has made a product to help anxious parents interpret their babies’ cries for help is among five Australian businesses to share in more than $1m worth of support from e-commerce giant Amazon.
Amazon Launchpad – a program launched in Australia in 2019 to support entrepreneurs across the country – has named its five latest innovation grant recipients, who will each receive more than $200,000 in cash, mentorship and marketing support.
Four Victorian start-ups including environmentally friendly toiletries business Baresop and alcohol-free beer producer UpFlow Brewing Co. are among the winners, together with Adelaide-based Goldilocks Suit.
Founded by Shem Richards and wife Laura in 2017, Goldilocks Suit has developed a smart singlet that uses sensors to monitor a baby’s breathing, body temperature, hunger and sleep patterns. Via a small module that clips into the onesie, and using machine learning algorithms, information is sent to an app where parents can gain insights into the development and wellbeing of their child.
