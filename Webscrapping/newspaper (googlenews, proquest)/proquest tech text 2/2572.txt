AUSTRALIANS are more open to using digital technology when it comes to their healthcare, a new survey has found.
Conducted by The Australian Digital Health Agency, the survey shows that 90 per cent of specialists are now more open to using extra technology when caring for their patients, including apps and online self-service.
In a similar survey, which evaluates consumer engagement with digital health services, there was also a marked increase in awareness of telehealth and remote healthcare.
Agency CEO Bettina McMahon said the research provided insight into a change in attitude towards technology in the face of COVID-19.
“This new research shows that we can expect digital health to remain a feature of healthcare into the future, now that consumers and healthcare professionals have experienced the convenience and benefits technology can bring,” she said. “Healthcare practitioners across the board are keen to do training in digital health services.”
