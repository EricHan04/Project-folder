Last summer was the hottest ever, well ahead of the previous record season of 2013. The Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed a similar situation this summer, advising that the risk of heatwaves is increased.
So now is the time to make sure your airconditioner is working at peak efficiency.
But if it is one of the older types, now is the time to consider replacing it with the latest technology.
Adelaide’s Sharpe Energy-Hub confirms that the latest generation of airconditioners run quieter, use 40 per cent less power and have smart technology, such as wi-fi control via a smart phone or computer.
This means you can get your property cooling before you even arrive home. Top-of-the-line systems also employ human sensor technology to adjust airflow and temperature automatically, depending on the number of people in a room. This significantly reduces running costs.
A good quality, well-maintained reverse-cycle airconditioner is one of the most cost-efficient ways to cool or heat a house, especially when linked to rooftop solar.
Sharpe Energy-Hub has had decades of experience in airconditioning. Now its expert advisers are on hand to analyse your energy use to help you find the best system to get you through these increasingly hot summers.
With 45 per cent of a typical power bill going on heating and cooling, it makes sense to consider upgrading to the latest generation of airconditioners.
Another bonus is that the latest battery technology is compatible with the latest airconditioners, further increasing your savings on energy costs, especially during those hot summer nights.
All these systems are installed and serviced by Sharpe’s own technicians, not subcontractors, to give reassurance regarding warranties and guarantees.
This is backed by the experience and knowledge of 39 years in business. So call Sharpe Energy-Hub and start taking the heat out of your summer.Energy-Hub, 71 Port Rd, Thebarton, 8272 9899, energy-hub.com.au
