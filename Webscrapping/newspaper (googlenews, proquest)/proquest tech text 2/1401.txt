IT’S the medical diagnosis that strikes instant fear – cancer. But astounding medical breakthroughs mean for many the disease is on the verge of becoming a chronic illness.
More than 150,000 Australians will be diagnosed with cancer this year and it will take the lives of 50,000 people.
The good news is outcomes in Australia are among the best in the world and survival rates are improving for most cancer types. Since the 1980s the number of cancer deaths has dropped 24 per cent.
Breast and prostate cancers have survival rates of more than 90 per cent. “We don’t like to use the word curing cancer but we’re talking durable, long-term control of cancer,” Melanoma Institute of Australia’s Professor Georgina Long said.
“People are surviving so well, that they’re dying of other things.” The National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) is aiming to eliminate deaths from the cancer by 2030 and the Prostate Cancer Foundation wants to eliminate deaths from this cancer by 2040.
“Why wouldn’t we try to achieve zero deaths from breast cancer when in the past 18 months or 20 months we’ve seen a global effort to eliminate a pandemic and that was really achievable because of the investment and the concerted effort of clinician scientists and epidemiologists,” NBCF research director Dr Samantha Oakes said.
A combination of prevention, screening, vaccines and new treatments are behind the improvements.
BREAST NEW TREATMENTS: • A drug, Lynparza, which costs more than $140,000, has been shown to reduce by 40 per cent the chance of breast cancer returning in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
• Statins including simvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin and pitavastatin prescribed to help lower cholesterol levels have been shown to improve breast cancer survival by 58 per cent in women with triple-negative breast cancer.
• Immunotherapy drug Keytruda was last year approved in the US for patients with high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, in combination with chemotherapy.
• Two drugs, Verzenio and Faslodex, help stop cancer cells from dividing and growing when used together.
RESEARCH: • Blocking tumour growth The Garvan Institute’s Dr Sharissa Latham has identified a new compound that blocks a protein from promoting growth of tumours in breast tissue.
• Stopping the spread The institute’s Professor Paul Timpson has identified a molecule that helps reduce cancer spread by 73 per cent. Breast cancer survival rates drop from 99 per cent to 27 per cent if a tumour metastasises.
• Which treatments?
A breakthrough method of classifying breast cancers developed by The Garvan Institute could predict which treatments work in individual women and which of them will respond to immunotherapy.
• Anti-nausea drug The University of Queensland’s Associate Professor Fiona Simpson found cancer treatments were better able to interact with the immune system when used with an infusion of cheap anti-nausea medication Stemetil.
• Triple negative Associate Professor Teresa Hickey, University of Adelaide, is investigating two drugs which could extend the life of triple negative breast cancer patients.
• Drugs to shrink tumours Common anti-allergy medications given at the same time as cancer immunotherapy have been associated with greater tumour shrinkage, say University of Texas researchers.
PREVENTION: • Blood test A trailblazing blood test that could warn women in their 30s they are at high risk of developing breast cancer is under development in Australia. The test is likely to cost less than $100 and checks for biomarkers of DNA damage.
PROSTATE NEW TREATMENTS: • Theranostics Theranostics, which combines diagnostic imaging with a new therapy, is set to revolutionise treatment of the most common cancer in men. It can be coupled with a new treatment TLX59 under development by Australian company Telix that targets a protein on the prostate cancer cell wall that kills the cancer. A Phase 3 trial is under way.
• Lynparza Last year the TGA approved a precision medicine Lynparza for an aggressive and advanced type of prostate cancer that has faulty DNA damage repair genes. Could benefit up to a third of men. It’s not yet subsidised.
• Nubeqa Nubeqa, a medication that works to inhibit male hormones which promote cancer growth, was approved for a government subsidy in July.
• Radioactive molecule A molecule that can kill cancer combined with a protein that can guide it toward tumours was added to standard of care treatments in prostate cancer patients last year. It improves overall survival from 11 months to 15 months.
RESEARCH • Genetic information Research is studying inherited cancer-causing genes in men with prostate cancer to better predict which men are likely to have more severe prostate cancer.
PREVENTION: • New blood test A new blood test has been found to perform as well as traditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for detecting prostate cancer. It has reduced the number of MRIs conducted by 36 per cent and biopsies by 8 per cent.
• Artificial Intelligence for early detection A new tool analyses existing patients’ PSA tests, MRIs and clinical parameters searching for complex trends that humans may not be able to see. Results are compared to a database of more than 250,000 prostate cancer cases. Men are being diagnosed five years earlier using the technology.
BOWEL NEW TREATMENTS: • Targeting genetic mutations Later this year patients with a BRAF genetic mutation, that means their cancer is more aggressive, are expected to benefit from a new treatment Braftovi that is expected to be subsidised. It will benefit 1500 bowel cancer patients.
• Immunotherapy Immunotherapy drug Keytruda uses the body’s own immune system to detect and fight cancer cells. It only works for a few hundred patients.
RESEARCH • Blood tests A blood test to detect shards of cancer DNA in a person’s bloodstream to see if their cancer has returned is being developed by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. A separate blood test by the CSIRO in collaboration with Flinders University and Australian-founded biotechnology firm Clinical Genomics detects circulating tumour DNA and can detect when bowel cancer returns.
• Vitamin D The SOLARIS trial is testing whether giving vitamin D with chemotherapy and another bowel cancer treatment helps shrink or stabilise bowel cancer in patients with metastatic disease.
• Psychiatric drug A study has found psychiatric drug lithium can boost stem cells in the gut making them more resistant to cancer cells. A clinical trial is set to take place in the Netherlands.
• Vaccine US researchers are trialling a vaccine that may help people in early stages.
PREVENTION: • Lower the screening age Bowel cancer can be successfully treated if caught early but only four in 10 people who are eligible take part in the screening program. The cancer is on the rise in young people. Bowel Cancer Australia wants the age at which Australians are screened reduced from 50 to 45.
• Blood tests The “yuck” factor gets in the way of people collecting stool samples to screen for bowel cancer. A blood test could dramatically lift screening rates. An Australian developed preventive test ColoStat is in clinical trials.
• Gut bacteria Researchers are trying to identify specific bacteria that could help screen patients for bowel cancer.
• Antibiotics UK researchers are investigating whether antibiotic use increases bowel cancer risk. Early evidence suggests it may increase the risk of colon cancer by 49 per cent.
MELANOMA NEW TREATMENTS: • Immunotherapy Half the patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma given a combination of two immunotherapies – Opdivo and Yervoy – are surviving for at least 6.5 years after diagnosis. Doctors hope it could be a cure.
A new immunotherapy called Relatlimab has been found to enhance the tumour- fighting response. After 12 months of treatment almost half the patients on the combination therapy had no disease progression; nearly two-thirds of patients on the single therapy had progressed.
• Earlier use of immunotherapies Stage two and three patients are being treated with immunotherapies. Research shows giving patients immunotherapy six weeks before their surgery is also a credible strategy.
RESEARCH • Personal immunotherapy Melanoma Institute researchers are testing patients’ tumours to see if they’re going to respond to standard therapy. If not, they determine the best approach for that individual, including experimental treatments.
• Personalised mRNA vaccine Melanoma Institute of Australia researchers are working on this with Moderna, who produced a Covid vaccine.
• Targeting certain genes Therapies that target a gene that encodes a protein called BRAF are helping 40 per cent of melanoma patients.
PREVENTION: • New diagnostic test A Melanoma Institute study is using genome data to develop a diagnostic test that improves the accuracy of diagnosis.
• Artificial intelligence Research is under way to use AI to examine skin lesion images to pick up melanoma earlier.
LUNG NEW TREATMENTS • Testing Scientists have identified 23 biomarkers for lung cancer, so treatment can be tailored. The hitch is genomic testing, which can cost thousands of dollars, is not yet subsidised.
• Imfinzi In 2020, this breakthrough medicine was subsidised for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer for use in patients who haven’t progressed after chemotherapy and radiation.
• Keytruda High-cost therapy combining immunotherapy Keytruda with chemotherapy has been shown to double five-year survival rates in non-small cell lung cancer patients from 5 per cent to almost 25 per cent.
• Tecentriq Tecentriq has been approved for small cell lung cancer, in combination with a platinum-based chemotherapy and the drug Etoposide. Patients who received Tecentriq after surgery in early-stage, non-small cell lung cancer instead of chemotherapy and/or radiation had a 34 per cent reduction in risk of return cancer.
• Lumykras This targets a previously undruggable molecule in one in eight patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It can shrink tumours by 37.1 per cent and increase survival by 12.5 months.
• Combinations Opdivo and Yervoy used together are improving long-term survival for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
RESEARCH • Spreading cancer cells More than 70 per cent of lung cancer patients present with cancers that have spread from the lung. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Researchers are looking for new treatments to kill the cancer cells that have spread.
• Immunotherapy response Garvan Institute researchers are trying to find better ways of predicting who responds to immunotherapy.
PREVENTION: • Blood test University Queensland’s Dr Arutha Kulasinghe is testing different types of breath, blood and biopsy to improve diagnosis.
• Screening A national program to screen people at high risk because of workplace exposure or smoking, and aged over 55, with a CAT scan every two years is being developed. “If we can detect it early, it’s estimated 12,000 lives will be saved over 10 years,” Lung Foundation Australia CEO Mark Brooke said.

Madilyn’s story ADELLA BEAINI MADILYN Chapman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at age four and spent months in hospital undergoing intense treatment.
Three years on, her family know how lucky they are to have her back home, but “never let their guard down and are never fully at ease”.
“Madilyn is living life normally but just has to be careful,” mum Alison Chapman said.
While Madilyn did not receive it, the treatment of blood cancers like hers are being transformed by new age Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell therapies.
The treatment extracts a patient’s white blood cells, programs them to target the cancer then reinfuses them to turn the patient’s own immune system against the cancer.
It has produced a 90 per cent remission rate in patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL).
Between 35 and 40 per cent of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have failed on other treatments have a complete remission Two such treatments – Kymriah and Yescarta – have been approved for use in Australia, costing $500,000 per patient.
It’s a one-off treatment that doctors describe as being “alive” because it persists in the body and continues to act as an anti-cancer treatment.
“I just wish we could fast forward now so that kids going through cancer now can be helped immediately now,” Mrs Chapman said.
“I seen it with Madilyn and it’s not fun.
“No child, parent or family should have to go through this so the idea of better medicine is amazing.”
Katherine’s story KATHERINE Longmire’s bowel cancer diagnosis came far later than it should have. First, her doctor misread the early warning signs, insisting she had constipation and needed to take a laxative. Then when she began passing blood, he told her she had haemorrhoids.
She changed GPs, was referred to a specialist for a colonoscopy and, at age 29, received the devastating news – “this is serious, you have cancer”.
The delayed diagnosis meant the cancer had spread to her lungs and she needed radiation to shrink the tumour before surgery because it was too large. Further surgeries removed metastases in her lungs and her rectum.
“Chemo has been the most challenging aspect for me through all of this,” she said.
“I’ve already had my chemo dose lowered once as I couldn’t tolerate it. My mental health has really suffered as well. Cancer can take your mind to dark places and most people around you can’t comprehend the full scale of what you’re experiencing.
“I would say to other young people it’s really important that you trust your gut. If something’s not adding up, you can go and ask to get a second opinion.” Ms Longmire, who still faces more surgery, lost her mother to a brain tumour eight years ago when she was in her 50s.
“I did think that watching her deteriorate over the course of about nine months was the worst thing that would ever happen to me; I still think it is. There has been no genetic cause identified for either of our cancers, so looks like a case of really, bad luck,” she said.
