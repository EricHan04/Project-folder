FINANCING A STRONG flow of capital into dedicated pre-IPO funds will keep the initial public offers flowing in 2022, John Kain, managing director of mid-tier M&A firm Kain Lawyers says.
Mr Kain, whose firm last year advised on deals including Archer Capital’s sale of V8 Supercars and Silk Laser’s $52m acquisition of Australian Skin Clinics, said the special purpose funds, which invested in private companies looking to list on the ASX in the short to medium term, had been growing in popularity.
While there have been players such as Regal Funds Management and Bombora active in the sector for some time, other investors were now increasingly looking to the strategy for strong returns.
Perennial got involved in the sector three years ago, Mr Kain said, and in August closed its third private-to-public fund, which raised $200m.
Microequities Asset Management in August also launched its “Private to Beyond the IPO Fund” which is targeting 15-25 per cent returns. That fund invested $5m in Adelaide artificial intelligence company Complexica in mid-2021, following up with another $3m in December.
Mr Kain said he’d be surprised if there wasn’t at least an extra half a billion dollars dedicated to pre-IPO funds by the end of the year.
Typically the investment horizon for such vehicles was about two years from investment to listing, he said. Last year was already an Australian record for total equity capital market raisings, with more than 1000 issues over the year, according to Refinitiv. In the calendar year to December 22, there was $US8.3bn ($11.4bn) raised through IPOs, up 148.9 per cent. Overall there was $US41bn raised, up 14.4 per cent, including the largest ever follow-on equity raising linked to CSL’s $US11.7bn purchase of Vifor Pharma.
