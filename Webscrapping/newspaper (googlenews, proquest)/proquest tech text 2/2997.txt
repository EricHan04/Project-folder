SOUTH Australian craft brewer Sparkke is taking its message of social change on a can to Victoria, with some strong investor backing.
The female-founded enterprise has bought a closed Collingwood pub, in inner Melbourne, with plans to breathe new life into it as a new craft brewery/pub operation, similar to what it has created in Adelaide. The Vine at Collingwood will open late next year and could create jobs for 30 full and part-time staff when it opens. Victorian investment business Founders First, which is building itself into a national craft beverages accelerator and has raised money to list on the Australian share market next week, is backing the move with funds. Founders First helped Sparkke with the redevelopment of The Whitmore pub/brewery, which opened in March this year.
Sparkke launched in November 2016 following the most successful pre-sale alcohol crowd-funding campaign in Australian history, and continues to challenge the local $15 billion-a-year, male-dominated alcohol industry, co-founder Rose Kentish said.
“Our new relationship with Founders First gives us the much-needed resources and connections to take Sparkke to the next level,” she said. “At heart, we’re social activists delivering to a market that wants to purchase from a company whose values and product ethos are aligned with theirs.”Sparkke’s cans sport messages to raise awareness and funds to boost equality, end racism and help the environment, among other causes.
