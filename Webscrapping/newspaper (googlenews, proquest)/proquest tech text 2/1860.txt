EDUCATION authorities are facing a challenge unique to the 21st century - the pace of technological change is so fast that by the time they devise courses, they’re already out of date.
The SACE Board’s move towards subjects where it sets a basic framework, while industry provides the most up to date content, is a smart way of tackling the issue.
Students will be able to leave school with the skills and knowledge employers value in emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, space and cybersecurity.
Similarly, Adelaide University has recognised that technological change, and associated issues of policy responses and sustainability, will be key to every area of research and teaching.
Its strategic plan proposes three new colleges that will give all researchers access to expertise in those areas.
Courses in these key areas may become compulsory, and at the very least accessible to all students.
Large educational institutions too often lag behind technological and societal changes in their offerings.
It is encouraging that both our secondary and tertiary sectors are looking to move with the times.
