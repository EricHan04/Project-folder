WHEN it comes to AFL, Adam Goodes has seen the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.
But these days that doesn’t even come into the equation.
“It might surprise people but I don’t think about footy at all,” Goodes says. Instead, the footy legend and proud Adnyamathanha and Narungga man, who grew up in South Australia, is pouring all his energies into reconnecting with his culture – and a special tree in the Flinders Ranges.
Pressed on the booing fiasco which prematurely ended his career, the dual Brownlow Medal winner and Sydney Swans premiership hero betrays no hint of regret, nor bitterness.
“I haven’t thought about it,” the 2014 Australian of the Year says softly, during an interview with SA Weekend.
“There’s nothing I could say or do during that period to change people’s opinions or get it to stop so, for me, it was all about ‘OK, well what positive things can I be doing in my life?’. And that’s where I’ve decided to stay.” Now he’s part of a new team running The Tracker Data Project – a collaboration with Dr Baden Pailthorpe and technologist Professor Angie Abdilla – which uses artificial intelligence to collect, among other things, GPS data from Goodes’ playing career.
It converts all this data into a magnificent piece of art, resembling a towering red gum, which holds a special place in the heart of Goodes’ extended family. It is on display at the Museum of Discovery, on North Tce.
