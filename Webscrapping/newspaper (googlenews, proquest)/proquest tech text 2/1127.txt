TECHNOLOGY SHARES in ASX-listed artificial intelligence data provider Appen have plummeted by more than 25 per cent, after the tech company posted a major earnings downgrade.
Appen, which provides AI data to tech giants and other companies, on Tuesday posted a year-on-year revenue drop of 7 per cent to $182.9m, blaming weaker advertising demand and a slowdown in spending from some of its largest customers.
Appen posted an underlying net loss of $3.8m – compared to a $12.5m net profit a year earlier – and a statutory net loss after tax of $9.4m. Underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation tumbled 69 per cent to $8.5m, sharply below market expectations. Appen shares slumped 27.3 per cent to $4.15 on Tuesday. “We remain committed to our longer-term growth strategy and confident of our prospects in the high growth AI market,” said CEO Mark Brayan (pictured).
