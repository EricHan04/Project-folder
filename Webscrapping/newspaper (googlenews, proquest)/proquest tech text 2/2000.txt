ANOTHER SA engineering firm has joined French giant Groupe FIVA’s stable of specialist capabilities.
Groupe FIVA has bought a majority stake in St Marys firm Kadego in a move to merge its capabilities with that of Hindmarsh company Cadgile, which was acquired in 2018.
Groupe FIVA has a partnership with defence company ASC to support France’s Naval Group in the design and build of 12 Shortfin Barracuda submarines for the navy. A long-time partner of Naval Group, Groupe FIVA is working with ASC to develop a submarine design workforce – and sees Cadgile and Kadego playing a key role in it.
Founded in 1999, Kadego specialises in virtual reality product design and digitisation. It will work collaboratively with Cadgile, a software design and drafting company, to offer the latest in engineering design support capability to the market, especially the defence sector.
Kadego’s 12 staff have joined Cadgile’s 25 staff at its new Port Rd offices, but its brand name and identity will be retained.
Kadego’s experience and capabilities in visualisation and digitisation of design, especially its virtual reality services, have a very important role to play, Groupe FIVA chief executive Yannick Vergez said.
“Kadego and Cadgile have very complementary services and their collaboration will add to the long-term sustainability of both whilst empowering us to deliver world-class local solutions to our Australia clients,” he said.
Kadego managing director Gavan Doyle said it had worked with companies like Minelab, Redarc and BAE.“The defence sector is rapidly evolving under the influence of cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, automation and big data. This is the value we add to Groupe FIVA’s work in SA and also what we can offer to Cadgile and its clients.”
