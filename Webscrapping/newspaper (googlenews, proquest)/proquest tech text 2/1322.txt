MACHINES are taking over, even venturing into the dark art of beer brewing, in an ­artificial intelligence experiment in Adelaide.
Using the computer power at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, two Adelaide University students trawled through 260,000 recipes for craft beer and filtered results for what the crowd liked.
Then they collaborated with Barossa Valley Brewing to actually make the stuff. The first taste-testing was served up by a robotic bartender built by AIML engineers. The robot detects an empty glass placed on the bar and automatically refills it.
“It tastes like the future – no, seriously, it’s a fruit-driven IPA, which I’m very proud of,” Barossa Valley Brewing founder Denham D’Silva said. The two computer science intern students, Christopher Fusco and Jash Vira, used AI to design a delicious beer, which they said was quite difficult. “We had to come up with our own mathematical formula using statistics from original recipes,” Mr Fusco said.
