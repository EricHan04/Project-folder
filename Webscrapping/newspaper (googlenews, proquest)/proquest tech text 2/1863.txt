WHEN man’s best friend gets a toothache – or perhaps a lion, mandrill, tiger, wombat, pet cat or a meerkat – “who you gonna call?” The nation’s only specialist veterinary dentist is based in Melbourne so for local work, it falls to veterinarian Dr Kristen Hailstone, of Hahndorf, who is in her final stages of residency with the American Veterinary Dental College.
This week she will address more than 2000 delegates from around the world at the Adelaide Convention Centre for the Australian Dental Congress. Dr Hailstone will give a presentation outlining her work including its similarity to human dentistry – and the difficulty sourcing canine crowns.
Fortunately, one of her clients at Adelaide Animal Emergency and Referral Centre at Kurralta Park makes human dental crowns so Dr Hailstone has been able to use the contact to make crowns for a variety of animals.
“In very simple terms, I am doing the work of a human dentist on dogs and cats. I move teeth around that are causing pain and difficulty to animals – some cannot even close their mouth properly as the teeth are pushing into the roof of their mouth and stopping it from closing,” Dr Hailstone said.While Dr Hailstone’s pro bono work at Adelaide Zoo included a day working on a lion, tiger, meerkat and mandrill, she says the oddest case she has come across was a puppy whose mouth lump contained more than 150 teeth ready to sprout. “I’ve now seen three cases like that, which is pretty unusual,” she said. The conference, from May 1-4, will feature 100 guest speakers examining several issues including the role of artificial intelligence in modern dentistry.
