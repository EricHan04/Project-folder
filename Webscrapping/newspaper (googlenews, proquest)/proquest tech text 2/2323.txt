NAB has set its sights on the global voluntary carbon market, teaming up with a handful of overseas banks to launch a new carbon offset platform it says will bring efficiency, liquidity and transparency to the fragmented ecosystem.
The big four lender, alongside Canada’s CIBC, Brazil’s Itau Unibanco and the UK’s NatWest Group, is launching Project Carbon, a voluntary carbon marketplace pilot, which will kick off in August and run for 12 weeks.
The program will test the effectiveness of the distributed ledger technology NAB hopes will transform the current market into one with clear and consistent pricing and standards as it helps its corporate clients manage climate risk.
“Tackling climate change is everyone’s job,” NAB chief executive Ross McEwan (pictured) said.
“We’re helping to find solutions and support our customers as they take action to transition to net-zero by 2050.
“Project Carbon is a terrific example of how technologies such as blockchain can address existing barriers and make carbon offsets more accessible for our customers – as part of their broader plans to reduce overall emissions and achieve their own targets.” With the use of blockchain and smart contracts, NAB hopes its platform will become the backbone of a future homogeneous global marketplace.
