Almost all the jobs of the future will need some STEM education, and these exciting opportunities certainly will. So where do you start? It might be science or tech or engineering or maths. The best advice is to pick what you enjoy and expect that tertiary education institutions will start adding courses to help you specialise later.
MEMORY OPTIMISERS Will augment people’s working memory capacities through digital implant technologies, and judicious memory erasure.
ROBOT ETHICISTS Will address ethical issues associated with artificial intelligence, robots, cyborg technologies and augmented/virtual reality.
OFF-WORLD HABITAT DESIGNERS Will create habitable buildings and environments on other planets.
DE-EXTINCTION GENETICISTS Will restore extinct animal and plant species, in order to rebalance ecosystems, improve agriculture, and create designer pets.
DRONE EXPERIENCE DESIGNERSWill work with drone fleet controllers to optimise people’s interactions with drones
