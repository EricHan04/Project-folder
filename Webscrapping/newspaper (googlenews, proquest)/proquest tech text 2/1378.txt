Artificial intelligence outfit Complexica, which is looking to list on the ASX in the medium term, is on the hunt for software companies it can acquire and inject its AI smarts into.
The Adelaide company, which has attracted pre-IPO investments from Microequities Asset Management and listed fund manager MA Financial, specialises in process and sales optimisation, and counts Pfizer, Pernod Ricard and Dulux group among its clients.
Complexica is on the hunt nationally for software firms with up to about $15m in revenue, which have an established product and customer base, but are yet to realise the gains possible from AI and machine learning.
Complexica managing director Matt Michalewicz said it was still early days in terms of the digitalisation of many business processes, and there was a lot of opportunity still to come in applying AI to logistics, sales, and other applications where complex decision-making processes were at play.
“2021 was a transformational year ... where we raised close to $20m in capital, expanded our management team with some very experienced hires,’’ he said. Complexica has raised $19m in pre-IPO growth funding since late last year, with a view to listing potentially later this year.
