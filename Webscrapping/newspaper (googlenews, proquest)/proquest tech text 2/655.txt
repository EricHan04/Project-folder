SOUTHERN Launch has retired the Taiwanese TiSPACE Hapith I rocket after the company’s third attempt to put it into space.
The South Australian start-up made multiple attempts at firing the rocket from its Whalers Bay orbital launch complex in the past fortnight.
Both natural and technological challenges contributed to the failure to launch. An inspection after the most recent attempt to launch the rocket on September 16 provided the company with undisclosed information but no further attempts will be made to launch it. “This test launch vehicle may not have taken Australia to space, however, it has provided our teams with valuable data and insights,” Southern Launch chief executive Lloyd Damp said.
