THE vision of new Botanic Gardens of South Australia director Michael Harvey to open up prime sites to attract more visitors more often is welcome.
The success of the recent Light Cycle show – which was extended because of demand – and other occasional events indicate there is considerable appetite for greater use of the gardens.
As Lot Fourteen comes alive and the Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre is built, the Adelaide Botanic Garden will be a vital neighbour and contribute to the ambience of the precinct.
Mr Harvey’s background in science museums also has the potential to enhance the gardens’ role in educating young people about natural history. SA’s economy relies on agriculture and horticulture and the gardens can inspire new generations to be excited by the science.
This would serve the state well as its scientific workforce grows and builds shared interests such as remote sensing developed by space and artificial intelligence experts alongside those who research plants.
Crucially, having a peaceful space in the heart of the CBD is an asset that can be enjoyed by all. Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Gemma Jones, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, SA ,5000
