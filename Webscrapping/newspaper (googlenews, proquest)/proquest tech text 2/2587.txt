A NEW state government plan sets an ambitious target to more than double the value of the health and medical industries sector to $5bn by 2030.
The Health and Medical Industries Sector Plan is a collaboration between the state government, industry and academic leaders, who have identified key enablers that will drive the value of the health and medical ­industries sector.
Premier Steven Marshall (above) says it is a “comprehensive road map” on how to take this fast-growing sector to new heights.
“This sector is a significant economic pillar of the South Australian economy and is already at the forefront of new and innovative technologies, employing nearly 24,000 people,” he said.
“We have one of the largest biomedical precincts in the Southern hemisphere — our $3.8bn Adelaide BioMed City — and with it we’re providing investors the opportunity to base their business among some of the brightest minds in the biotech, digital health and ageing well industry.” The plan has identified three key targets including creating a cohesive industry presence, attracting further international clinical trials, and growing the ageing well and care industry.
The first will be driven through an industry connectivity initiative, which will collate data, including surveys.
The SA Health Clinical Trials Portal will be central to the second target, attracting international trials by acting as a single point of entry for new trials and reporting on clinical trial capability and capacity.
Finally, growth within the ageing well and care industry will build on the existing $427m worth of service exports, driving NDIS participation and increasing overseas project partnerships. The plan is one of nine industry sector plans under SA’s “Growth State” initiative.
