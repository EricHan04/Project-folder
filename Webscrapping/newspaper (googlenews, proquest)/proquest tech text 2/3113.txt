A South Australian man has been sentenced to two years' jail for possessing more than 1,000 files of child exploitation material, which included graphic images & videos of children as young as three being sexually abused.
The 51-year-old man was arrested by the South Australia Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team (SA JACET) team in October 2019, after an investigation sparked by a tip from the United States National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
A person believed to be in South Australia had allegedly uploaded child abuse material to online platforms.
SA JACET investigators identified the South Australian man as the suspected user of the account.
Police executed a search warrant at his home in Gawler, north of Adelaide, & found child abuse & bestiality material on several data storage devices.
The content included videos, images & animated images involving children suspected to be as young as three.
He pleaded guilty in July 2020 to possessing or controlling child abuse material obtained or accessed using a carriage service.
The man was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years, six months & 19 days, to be served in the community under a two-year recognizance release order.
