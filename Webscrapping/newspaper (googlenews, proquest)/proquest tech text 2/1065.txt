DEALS SHARES in ASX-listed artificial intelligence specialist Appen skyrocketed after the company received a $1.2bn unsolicited takeover offer, but the bid was later pulled.
Appen shares surged after the company disclosed it received a $9.50 per share non-binding offer from Canadian IT services outfit Telus International. The offer price was a 48 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price of $6.40.
Shares in Appen rose 29.22 per cent to $8.27 on Thursday before the company entered a trading halt. The stock traded as high as $43.66 in August 2020.
“Appen engaged with Telus in good faith through its advisers to better understand the conditions of the indicative proposal and to agree an appropriate confidentiality and standstill agreement, after which Appen was prepared to make available limited business and financial information,” the company said in a late afternoon statement. “This afternoon, Telus informed us that they were revoking their indicative proposal. No reasons were given … no confidential information was provided.” The two companies had been in discussions about the takeover proposal for some weeks, sources close to the discussions said. Appen, led by CEO Mark Brayan, creates human-curated datasets to train artificial intelligence programs. It has been hit by privacy changes made by Apple to iPhones, changes that have also affected Facebook. Appen on Thursday also delivered a trading update saying year-to-date revenue and orders in hand were $US297m ($418.5m), up 14 per cent on year. RBC Capital Markets analyst Garry Sherriff said Appen’s trading update implied that difficult operating conditions remain — and first half earnings are expected to be materially lower than the prior corresponding period.
