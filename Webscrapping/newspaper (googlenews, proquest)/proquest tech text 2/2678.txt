TRAVEL A TEAM of Australian data analytics experts have used their downtime during the Covid-19 pandemic to develop a world-first tool for travellers to quickly assess the risk of their journey.
Called GOPASS Global, the platform has already been rolled out to a number of travel industry heavyweights including Lufthansa, Sabre and Global Travel Network.
Covering 3900 airports in 240 countries, and 260 aircraft types across 732 airlines, the platform uses information from 35 data sources to calculate the level of Covid-19 risk to a traveller throughout their trip. GOPASS chief executive Mark Radford said the product aimed to fill the need for “risk management” for travellers in a pandemic world. As well as delivering a risk rating between one (low) and 10 (extreme), the platform provided travellers with up-to-the-minute information about their health and legal obligations.
