KATE Miller-Heidke admits it’s still taking a little time to come back down to earth after her top 10 finish at Eurovision this year.
“It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life and probably will always be that,” she says.
But while it might have been an incredible time, Eurovision was also an extremely expensive one. Kate managed to crowd-fund more than $60,000 just to take part.
“One of the things that people don’t realise is that every country needs to make a significant donation to the European Broadcasting Union,” Kate says.
“There was also the staging we used, which meant freighting the swing poles over to Tel Aviv. I also wanted to use all Australian artists, the aerial artists from (performing arts company) Strange Fruit, which meant getting then over there, as well.
“My management did a great job of patch-working all the funding together – some of it was government funding and the flights were covered by Flight Centre. Crowd-funding was important for us, as well.” Kate is enjoying a week-long break with her family before heading back to Adelaide for the Cabaret Festival, playing a show at the Thebarton Theatre on June 22.
“I last played the ‘Thebby’ about 10 years ago, early on in my career, and it’s such a beautiful space, so I’m really looking forward to getting back there again,” she says.
And while she treasures the whole Eurovision experience, Kate says she’s thrilled to finally be singing different songs again.
“I think the great thing about doing Eurovision has been seeing some new faces in the audience, but also seeing people who have now come back to my music,” Kate says.see: Tickets to all Adelaide Cabaret Festival shows are available through BASS
