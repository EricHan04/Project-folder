EXPORTS AN AUSTRALIAN sports drink start-up is targeting America’s 30 million Strava users as it prepares to launch into the potentially lucrative US market.
PREPD will initially launch in the US via an e-commerce offering, but it is also in talks with sports dietitians who could open doors to elite athletes and professional sporting organisations.
The product is a two-step hydration enhancer consumed 6-12 hours before, and then after exertion, and is designed to boost the absorption of electrolyte drinks or water.
PREPD chief executive Andrew Perry said the Adelaide-based company would look to raise at least $750,000 via an equity crowdfunding campaign early in the new year to support its US expansion.
PREPD recently completed a US Strava challenge during the country’s marathon season, to boost the brand’s profile. Close to 152,000 participants signed up to the challenge on Strava, the world’s largest social fitness platform which set a target of completing eight hours of exercise over a four-week period. “Something like 16.3 million people saw our product or had impressions on the Strava channels – in terms of getting in front of that many eyeballs it’s hard to do without using a global platform like Strava,” he said Locally in Australia, PREPD is sold online and is stocked in specialty retailers.
Since launching in 2018, it has been used by elite cricketers, AFL teams, professional cyclists and A-League soccer teams.
Last AFL season seven clubs used the product, while four more are currently trialling it as part of their pre-season training. Yale University in the US is trialling PREPD for its sports program. Olympic hurdler Michelle Jenneke, who has more than 550,000 Instagram followers, is now a global brand ambassador.
