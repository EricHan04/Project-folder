Cameron makes a Giant call FROM BACK PAGE “We have open honest conversations so I said I think the time is right to have a bit of breathing space for the club to look for its next coach.
“It’s a tough job and it can wear you down and people will speculate, but I am proud to say it’s a joint decision between the coach and club.
“I was walking around here on Tuesday at training and I know I have still got the players, but it’s a zapping job and sometimes that can wear you down a little bit but that’s not just the one reason.
“There are a whole bunch of reasons, we all in life try to find the perfect moment to make the decision. This is a good decision, the timing is right for our footy club to look for our senior coach. I am the one and Dave is the one that made the decision together.” Premiership coach Alastair Clarkson will become a hot favourite to take over for the Giants at the end of the season. At the moment, the market has McVeigh $3, Clarkson $6, Adam Kingsley $7, Adem Yze $7 and Hird at $10.
Matthews hailed Cameron for his near-decade of service at the club and said very few figures left a legacy of elite coaching and club-building given the Giants’ expansion role in the AFL.
“Leon Cameron has an amazing legacy at this club, he’s done an outstanding job over a long period of time and his legacy is absolutely assured,” Cameron said.
“He has taken us to finals, won finals, done what a lot of AFL coaches haven’t done and that’s build a club. He has created a culture that is very resilient and addressed a young start-up club in this fierce competition.” Cameron said he and his family would love to stay in Sydney but he has not ruled out coaching again.
