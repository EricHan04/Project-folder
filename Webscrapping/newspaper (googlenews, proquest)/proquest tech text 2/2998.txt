New York: Former senior Trump right-wing strategist Steve Bannon has been arr­ested and charged along with three others for defrauding hundreds of thousands of ­donors in a Mexico border wall fundraising campaign.
The man credited with orchestrating Donald Trump’s 2016 election win pleaded not guilty to money-laundering and fraud charges. He was released on $US5m ($7m) bail.
The online crowd-funding campaign, known as We Build the Wall, raised more than $25m, prosecutors said, which the defendants promised would go towards construction of Mr Trump’s Mexico wall but which they allegedly siph­oned off into their own pockets. The President aimed to distance himself from the plot, saying: “Don’t know anything about the project at all – I think it’s a very sad thing for Mr Bannon.”
