ISRAEL Folau is likely to be in the stands when Australia plays New Zealand tonight after the sacked Wallabies star was spotted in Liverpool.
Folau has travelled to the Netball World Cup to support his wife, Silver Ferns shooter Maria.
Folau, caught up in a legal battle with Rugby Australia over his contract after a social media post claiming “hell awaits” gay people, has kept a low profile in Liverpool, ­staying off social media.
But there’s every chance he will be courtside when Maria and New Zealand line up against the Diamonds.
Even before Folau arrived, the saga surrounding his ­religious views had bled into netball’s biggest tournament.
Maria came under fire for endorsing Folau’s crowd-funding efforts to help pay his legal fees but declined to speak to the media.
Netball Australia, Super Netball and Maria’s club, Adelaide Thunderbirds, determined her Instagram post had not breached their social media policy and made no sanction. Netball legend Liz Ellis said that was “not good enough”, while Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander said the issue was more complicated.The Silver Ferns have made it clear their priority is Maria’s wellbeing.
