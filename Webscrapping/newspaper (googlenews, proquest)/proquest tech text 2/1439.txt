IN NORMAL times it’s unusual for a container ship to miss its “window” at Flinders Ports’ container terminal at Port Adelaide.
But these are not normal times, and during the past five months not a single ship has hit its window – something that chief executive Stewart Lammin (pictured) has never seen during his almost four decades in the sector.
With sea freight rates going through the roof, some shipping lines are simply bypassing ports such as Adelaide, Mr Lammin says, chasing bigger dollars on transatlantic and Asian routes.
The number of container ships going through Port Adelaide is down about 30 per cent but Mr Lammin is optimistic of improvement.
The company, which is owned by major superannuation funds such as MTAA and Perpetual, has recently competed a 50-year plan and is about to go live with an artificial intelligence solution to transform the way containers move through its terminals.
But in the meantime there are some challenges, including ships missing their scheduled arrival times. Mr Lammin said this cascaded into shipping lines trying to reorganise their schedules, “and that means you have to bypass some ports’’, with Adelaide currently being affected. “There’s been talk about whether it’s going to be six months or 12 months or two years for this to sort itself out,’’ Mr Lammin said. “The industry has generally recovered from blips fairly quickly … I’d like to hope that some time in ’22 this will start to sort itself out.’’
