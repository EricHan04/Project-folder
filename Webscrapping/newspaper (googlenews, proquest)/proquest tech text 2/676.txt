Accommodation shortage holding back jobs growth
PLANS are afoot to help fix a shortage of workers’ accommodation in Robe that is so acute one employer is sleeping in a tent so his staff can live in his home.
Brad Scott, the owner of Transmutation, which makes homewares out of recycled plastic, has lodged plans with Robe Council to create an accommodation village next to his business.
Mr Scott, who also heads up Robe’s tourism association, said while business had been booming, companies were struggling to fill positions because there was nowhere for staff to stay.
“It’s been a problem for a year or two but now it’s getting more acute because we’re getting busier and busier for longer,” he said.
Mr Scott plans to build an accommodation camp sympathetic with the area’s industrial zoning. It would include 24 rooms with ensuites, all booked on a weekly basis through the businesses who employed the workers.
Negotiations are underway for the container recycling business next door to Transmutation to move to the council’s depot, making way for the accommodation.
Claudio Carta, who co-owns eatery Food Lab Robe, said the accommodation would be “the best thing ever” for his town.
He had been sleeping in a tent in his backyard so his staff could live in his home.
Mr Carta had seven staff, but said he could employ another five by opening up a veranda and beer garden, if the town had enough accommodation. He also wanted to start up a new restaurant and retail outlet, but said the accommodation shortage was also holding those plans back.
