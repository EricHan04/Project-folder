COULD a global giant be jetting into Lot Fourteen?
The word around town is that the world’s biggest aerospace company, Boeing, is considering shifting its Adelaide operations to the former Royal Adelaide Hospital site that will house the Australian Space Agency and a defence and tech start-up hub.
The aviation giant flew into the CBD less than two years ago as part of a five-year plan to set up a new city hub, secured through the state’s investment attraction agency and Defence SA.
It initially set up shop in Currie St but, in what would be a big coup in the transformation of the old hospital, Boeing could be persuaded to take off to Lot Fourteen.
When asked by Off the Record if the company was either considering or offered to relocate to the transformational site, a Boeing spokeswoman kept her cards close to her chest.
“Boeing Defence Australia is currently assessing its long-term Adelaide facilities requirements to meet the company’s South Australia growth plans,” she said.
“Various locations are being reviewed; however, we won’t be disclosing details of specific sites under consideration.” Boeing is building on support operations in SA, which include the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon and Collins Class submarine (above).
But the old RAH site would seem a good fit. A city deal inked last December, centred on Lot 14, aims for targeted investment to deliver a precinct that drives entrepreneurship and innovation.
