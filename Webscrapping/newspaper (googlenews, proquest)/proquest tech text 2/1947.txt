NEW Zealand could play an active role in reforming social networks and holding them to account for distressing content after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern revealed she had talked to top Facebook executives and there were “further questions to be answered” about their role.
The revelations follow widespread criticism of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter for failing to stop the spread of a brutal, graphic video circulating on their networks from the Christchurch shooting, which claimed the lives of 50 people.
The video, broadcast live on Facebook for 17 minutes, remained available to view for hours after the attack, despite the requests of New Zealand Police to remove it.
Ms Ardern said she had discussed the issue with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. “I do think that there are further questions to be answered,” she said.Facebook spokeswoman Mia Garlick said the company’s human moderators and artificial intelligence software had continued to remove “violating content” of the shooting from the network.
