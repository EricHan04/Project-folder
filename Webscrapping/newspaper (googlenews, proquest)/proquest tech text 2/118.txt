STAY-AT-HOME mothers deserve greater recognition and support, says one South Australian mother, who put her career on hold to raise her four young children.
Claire Hoban has shared why she chose to become a stay-at-home mum in a first-person piece in today’s SAWeekend magazine.
She had worked as head of operations for health and technology start-up companies before completing her PhD while pregnant with her first child.
“I found that becoming a mum triggered something instinctual and primal catalysing a deeply biological pull to be with my child 24/7,” she said.
“The first 1000 days (from conception to age two) are a critically important time in the development of a baby’s brain … we made a decision to keep the babies with me until at least that time.” While Mrs Hoban, who credits the support of her husband, Luke, acknowledges some families require two full-time incomes, she said modern society needed to support mothers who wished to pause their paid work.
“Since the government first subsidised childcare in 1972, we have seen a rise in care options,” she said.
“The suggestion is clear – children are better off in the care of others and the work of a stay-at-home mum is undervalued.
“It is a role that is sometimes viewed as an indulgence and confused with being a ‘lady of leisure’.” Mrs Hoban said she “dreads the grief” of her children – Sophie, 2, Ted, seven months, Henry, 6, and Charlotte, 5 – not needing her so much. “I can’t imagine a day without seeing them, or hearing their voices,” she said. “Or seeing a hallway free from a selection of small toys. Missing mandarin peel that hasn’t quite made its final destination and is left (near) the bin.”
