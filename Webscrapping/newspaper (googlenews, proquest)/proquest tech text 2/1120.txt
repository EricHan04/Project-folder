The eyes are not just the windows to the soul, they can also indicate heart disease risk.
An international research team found artificial intelligence-enabled imaging of the retinaâ€™s network of veins and arteries can predict cardiovascular disease.
The team applied AI models developed from the data of 88,000 UK participants to retinal images of 7411 different adults aged 48-92. The participants were tracked for seven to nine years and captured between half and two-thirds of circulatory disease deaths in those most at risk.
