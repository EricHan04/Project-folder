BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES - SPONSORED CONTENT World-leading university the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has picked Adelaide as the place to establish a big data laboratory.
Adelaide is a prime location “due to its leadership in data analytics and machine learning”, the university’s Professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland says.
MIT’s Living Laboratory, to be established at Lot Fourteen in the city centre, will bring together students, researchers and commercial interests to trawl through data from mobile phones, banking services, government transactions, GPS tracking, satellite imagery and other sources.
Working with BankSA, Optus and the State Government, it will guide government decisions and develop products with commercial outcomes.
“Data is the future,” South Australian Premier Steven Marshall says. “The data we are getting in now will inform decision-making for government projects, industry projects and future prosperity. It will improve productivity and, most importantly, create more jobs.“It will bolster entrepreneurial activity across a range of industries and ensure that this state remains at the forefront of global innovation and enterprise.”
