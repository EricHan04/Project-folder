A NEW, more effective vaccine to protect people who have severe allergic reactions to European bee stings is being developed in Adelaide.
An initial human trial found it boosts the amount of “blocking” antibodies recipients produce that help prevent anaphylactic shock.
The trial at Flinders University and the Royal Adelaide Hospital involved 27 adults with a history of allergic reactions to bee stings.
Some were given the new vaccine, and some an existing immunotherapy treatment, both in 50 doses over three years – the current treatment standard. It is hoped the new vaccine will eventually involve far fewer injections over a shorter period.
Flinders University Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, pictured, said recipients of the new vaccine produced the “good” antibodies “earlier and at much higher levels” each time they were subjected to injections containing venom.
“Their (allergic) reactions diminished throughout the study. The swelling was smaller each time,” he said.
Prof Petrovsky said the real test would come in the next trial, to start late next year, in which participants would have to face actual bee stings instead of controlled venom injections. He said a “sting challenge” was the “gold standard” as a “live sting” was chemically different. It was not used in the initial trial for safety reasons, given anaphylactic shock can be deadly.The vaccine’s unique ingredient, developed in Adelaide by Vaxine Pty Ltd, has been used to develop other vaccines for a range of conditions. Vaxine has produced a flu vaccine designed entirely by artificial intelligence.
