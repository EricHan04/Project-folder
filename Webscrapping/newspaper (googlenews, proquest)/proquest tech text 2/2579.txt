THE man in charge of fitting up nine in 10 Australians with a controversial online My Health Record has resigned less than a year after the opt-out version was rolled out.
Australian Digital Health Agency chief executive Tim Kelsey was associated with the fraught rollout of a similar online health record in the UK.
And his resignation comes before the $1.5 billion Australian digital health record has been accepted by the medical profession or the public.The Federal Government switched the record from an opt-in to an opt-out system in January and was forced to make substantial changes to the legislation.
