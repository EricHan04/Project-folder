A MELBOURNE business is facing the squeeze from tech giant Apple in a legal challenge over its fruit-based name.
Personal finance start-up Pineapple is in a David and Goliath battle with one of the world’s biggest companies.
Lawyers acting for Apple have opposed their trademark and issued a letter requesting they stop using the name Pineapple.
Co-founders Kari Marsden and Luke Campbell said it was a shock having a multinational company try to squash the use of their name.
“We think apples and pineapples are pretty different,” Ms Marsden said. Ms Marsden and Mr Campbell quit their jobs in the banking industry last year to work full-time on the business.
Their app and website went live on Saturday with the legal cloud still hanging over them. Ms Marsden said they were eager to keep the Pineapple name because they had spent a lot of time and effort researching it and coming up with the brand. “Obviously it’s Aussie slang for the $50 note, but it also stands for fun, sun and holidays,” she said. “We love the name and people have told us they love the name too.” The business is targeted at young people and is described as a “financial wellbeing wallet” to help people manage their budgets. The duo have engaged a trademark lawyer to assist in what could be a long-running legal issue.
