DEFENCE contractor BAE Systems Australia has joined forces with education technology start-up Lumination at Thebarton to steer primary school students towards STEM careers.
Beacon targets students who might otherwise miss out on STEM extension activities and immersive technology such as virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.
The five SA schools involved in the 10-week learning program are Northfield Primary, Paralowie R-12, Enfield Primary, Oakbank and Pennington R-6.
BAE Systems Australia chief Ben Hudson said he was “very proud to support an initiative that brings contemporary technology into the classroom to both inspire students and support teachers”.
Lumination’s head of education Rebecca Bendikov said Beacon would give students new skills to take back to the classroom and inspire them to consider STEM careers. “The content links directly to the curriculum and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals specifically around land, air and sea,” she said.
