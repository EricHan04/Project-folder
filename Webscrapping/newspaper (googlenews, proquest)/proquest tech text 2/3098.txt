MAVERICK MP Bob Katter will be among the speakers at an anti-China rally in the city today.
Among the protesters’ targets will be new Adelaide University vice-chancellor Peter Hoj and the uni’s Confucius Institute. Queensland MP Mr Katter is leading a parliamentary push to stop government agencies including Defence using Chinese-run companies for data storage contracts.
Anti-China student activist Drew Pavlou, who was suspended from Queensland University for misconduct when Professor Hoj was in charge there, will continue his campaign against his appointment to Adelaide Uni.
South Australian senator Rex Patrick, who said he did not agree with all of Mr Katter and Mr Pavlou’s views, will speak about his Bill to ban imports from China’s Xinjiang province, where the Uyghur minority is persecuted. He urged Adelaide University to close its Confucius Institute – around the country the institutes are accused of peddling Chinese influence – but the uni said it was fully under its control and not engaged in any political activities.
