ENERGY WOODSIDE Petroleum plans to spend $US5bn ($7bn) in emerging new energy markets by 2030 amid a broader challenge to the oil and gas industry to lift its response to climate change pressures.
The company’s $40bn merger with BHP Petroleum will catapult it into a top 10 global energy player next year and, while Woodside expects oil and gas to remain a big earnings contributor, it’s increasingly looking to invest in areas spanning hydrogen, carbon capture and solar thermal energy.
The new energy growth plan could boast potential capacity of 3000 megawatts by 2030 as Woodside looks to cut its emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.
“We expect LNG to remain an important part of the energy mix in our region for decades to come, both as a lower carbon source of fuel for coal-dependent countries and as convenient firming capacity for renewables,” chief executive Meg O’Neill said as part of an investor update on Wednesday.
“But our significant investment target in new energy is aimed at positioning Woodside as an early mover in this evolving market and supporting the decarbonisation goals of our customers.” Woodside called out hydrogen for heavy vehicle transport and ammonia for power generation as two near-term areas of focus for its customers. It is also looking to build a solar thermal demonstration plant in California with Heliogen, along with a liquid hydrogen project, H2OK, in Oklahoma.
“We expect that in the mid-2020s the transition to new energy will be under way, including the start-up of the first of our own projects,” Ms O’Neill said. The Woodside merger with BHP’s petroleum arm is expected to be completed in the June quarter next year. Woodside rose 2.1 per cent to $22.40 on Wednesday.
