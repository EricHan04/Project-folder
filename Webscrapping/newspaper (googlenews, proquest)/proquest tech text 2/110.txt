THE co-founder and chief executive of spinal implant maker Additive Surgical is among a list of South Australian business leaders to have received funding through the Industry Leaders Fund’s grants program.
Gibran Maher leads a diverse list of grant recipients this year, and is the ILF’s first Indigenous scholar. Other grant recipients include Cambodian-born Anthony Chhoy, the co-chief executive of education technology start-up Makers Empire, Kashmiri Australian Jenal Dhar, an IT manager with Tata Consultancy Services, and South African Indian descendant Kimal Singh, who heads up engineering company NDE Solutions.
Unico Zelo and Applewood Distillery managing director Laura Carter is one of four female grant recipients.
Half of the 24 grant recipients, who have been awarded a combined $235,000, are engaged in IT or hi-tech manufacturing. ILF chief executive Geoff Vogt said it was the highest representation in the program’s 12-year history.
“This is the strongest indicator yet that the state’s transition from traditional to hi-tech and advanced manufacturing has been successful,’’ he said. The ILF grants support current and future business executives through professional education – the scholars are expected to apply their learning to grow the SA economy.
