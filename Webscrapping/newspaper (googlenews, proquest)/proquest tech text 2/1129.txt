#FEARLESS CONVERSATIONS HOW teachers find the right balance between including emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and incorporating real-life learning has been discussed at a forum in Adelaide.
A trio of education experts has faced off to discuss the elements of modern teaching and what is needed most moving forward to best prepare all students for life and work post-school.
Developing children’s critical and creative thinking, as well as building social and interpersonal skills, emerged as a focus during the session on innovative education and pedagogy.
“We don’t want to be equipping our young people to just compete with the robots,” SA Education Department chief executive Martin Westwell said.
Mr Westwell, who previously headed up SACE board, was joined at the Flinders University and The ­Advertiser Fearless Conversations event by lecturer in educational leadership and management at Flinders University Andrew Bills, and Flinders University senior lecturer in psychology and social work Joss Rankin.
Dr Bills said the community needed to drive public education. “The aspiration … is to have schools that truly reflect communities that are culturally diverse (and) have a socio-economic mix,” Dr Bills said.
“It revolves around looking at public education, not as single schools but as a collective of schools … where best practices are shared.” The discussion, part of Flinders University and The Advertiser Fearless Conversations series, can be heard in full at advertiser.com.au/fearless-conversations
