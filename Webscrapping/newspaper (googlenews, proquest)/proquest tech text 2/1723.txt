WHEN Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused a storm surge that flooded New York, musician, author, composer and performance artist Laurie Anderson lost her body of work.
Anderson, who was living with husband Lou Reed (who died the following year) kept her archives in the basement and the surge of seawater destroyed the lot.
“We really didn’t expect it to be quite so mega but now everything has a mega in front of it, monster storm or monster fire,” she said in Adelaide for two Fringe performances and a week-long artist residency. “I kind of lost everything which was difficult at first, then … we really didn’t need all that stuff.” It became the jumping off point for her multi-layered concert, All the Things I Lost in the Flood, which is about a lot more than losing things.
“It’s about language and stories and frustration and happiness and dreams and also there is hypnosis in there and it’s about Songs From the Bardo which is a record I put out recently,” she said.
Anderson, whose history with Adelaide Festivals goes back 30 years, is also the inaugural Art Intelligence artist-in-residence, a collaboration between the Australian Institute for Machine Learning at Lot Fourteen and the Sia Furler Institute at the University of Adelaide. Anderson, a former artist-in-residence at NASA, is spending a week beginning a new work based around Artificial Intelligence, working with the students.
“I don’t think AI has great capabilities to create by itself but as a collaborator, I cannot think of anything more powerful,” she says.
The form of the result is unknown; it could be a book or an opera, a performance, a sonnet or a website.
“It’s pretty open because I don’t know yet what the machine is going to do,” she said. “It is exciting, I love that. I love not knowing what I am writing.”SEE:Laurie Anderson: All the Things I Lost in the Flood, Bonython Hall, RCC, March 14-15 tickets: adelaidefringe.com.au
