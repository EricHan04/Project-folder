A NATIONAL plan to get more people upskilled in digital health will be released today following widespread demand for online services during the pandemic.
The road map will set out goals to incorporate more technology into Australian health systems to make services more accessible, including the use of electronic prescriptions.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the importance of access to healthcare through the internet had been shown over the past six months.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of these systems to ensure delivery of quality patient care during an emergency,” Mr Hunt said.
“A dramatic expansion in the use of telehealth has been a key element of the fight against COVID-19. “ Between March and September almost 30 million Medicare-eligible telehealth services were delivered to more than 10 million Australians.
Electronic prescription services have also been fast tracked as part of the plan, giving patients more flexibility and the ability to receive prescriptions via text or email. The e-prescription, containing electronic token, can then be forwarded or handed to a pharmacist to fulfil.
