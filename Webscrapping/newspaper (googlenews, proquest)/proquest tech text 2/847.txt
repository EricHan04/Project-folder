ExxonMobil plans to develop a major carbon capture and storage project offshore Victoria’s Gippsland Basin, the latest push by the oil and gas industry to boost its green credentials.
The US energy giant is undertaking early engineering and design studies for a potential facility that can capture 2 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide with start up expected in 2025.
The scheme would use existing infrastructure to store carbon in the depleted Bream field off the coast of Victoria’s Gippsland Basin where Exxon already owns and operates a string of major oil and gas projects.
Exxon said it was in discussions with local industries interested in accessing the hub, known as the South East Australian carbon capture and storage facility.
“Collaboration with other industries is an important step to unlock future carbon capture and storage opportunities for Australia, with the potential for large-scale reductions in the highest emitting industrial sectors,” said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.
The potential carbon capture hub adds to gradual momentum from industry in backing the technology which has suffered from high costs and problems scaling projects to a sufficient level to make a dent in high emissions from the oil and gas sector.
Santos is seen as the frontrunner among Australian companies for developing carbon capture and storage. It is already devising a giant ‘‘carbon sink’’ scheme where it can offer energy operators the ability to strip out and bury carbon from their gas supplies at its Moomba hub in South Australia.
