COMPUTER systems at SA Health will be turbo-charged as part of a $2 million investment to improve patient care.
The State Government will put $1.2 million towards increased bandwidth to make IT systems faster and increase their capacity.
Chief medical information officer Dr Santosh Verghese said network capacity needed to be increased to ensure staff could capitalise on available technologies.“It is not efficient for our clinical staff to have to wait to download emails and reports or access applications they require to perform their duties,” Dr Verghese said. The Government will also invest $750,000 in partnership with the Digital Health Co-operative Research Centre, linking clinicians with digital technology to make their work more efficient.
