ADELAIDE is one of the least green cities in the country, beating only Perth for tree canopy and way behind the eastern capitals, the first Australia-wide study of its kind has found.
Aerial survey company Nearmap analysed 5000 suburbs across Australia. It then calculated what proportion of each city’s population lived in populated “leafy” suburbs with a total tree cover greater than 20 per cent.
Adelaide was seventh among capital cities with just over one quarter (26 per cent) of residents living in leafy suburbs. Brisbane came in at No.1, at 79 per cent.
Adelaide’s western suburbs scored particularly poorly.
Nearmap artificial intelligence systems senior director Dr Michael Bewley said some cities and suburbs fit “a lot of people and a lot of buildings and a lot of trees in the one area”, so there did not have to be a trade-off between trees and development.
“It paints a picture of hope that we can have really liveable cities, because it’s not just the environment angle – trees are important for mental health, for physical health, for water quality and for heat island effects particularly,” he said.
The Green Adelaide landscape management board said the study provided “terrific additional information ”. However acting director Stuart Collard said Nearmap used “an emerging and novel method that is quite different to what has been undertaken across Adelaide previously”, that focused on residential areas and excluded public parks. Green Adelaide is working on its own “tree canopy and urban heat data set”, updating the last effort in 2018.
