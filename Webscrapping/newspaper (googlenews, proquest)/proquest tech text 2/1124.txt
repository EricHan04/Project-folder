ARTIFICIAL intelligence could bring researchers a step closer to finding a treatment for tinnitus, thanks to a new diagnostic test under development in Melbourne.
There has been no objective test to diagnose or measure the severity of tinnitus, which impacts one-in-10 ­people.
But a diagnostic test under development at the renowned Bionics Institute in Melbourne could be about to change that. Researcher Mehrnaz Shoushtarian said it could be difficult for researchers to find a treatment when they could not make an objective diagnosis. “Our aim is to provide clinicians with a reliable diagnostic test to assess if a treatment is working and also give researchers the information about brain activity in tinnitus needed to develop new treatments,” she said.
