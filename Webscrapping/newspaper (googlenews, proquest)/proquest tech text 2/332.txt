According to accountants and business advisory firm Pitcher Partners, Bain Capital’s $3.5bn takeover of Virgin Australia took the lion’s share of the $10bn disclosed deals last year, 12 per cent less that the $11.5bn in 2019.
Overall, there were 265 deals announced last year, a 14 per cent drop on 2019 with technology, media and telecommunications (52 deals), energy, mining and utilities (37) and agriculture (19) which showed the sharpest increase in transactions.
Pitcher Partners partner in charge of corporate finance Warwick Face said it was a “tale of two halves”.
Transaction volumes in the first half of 2020 fell by 36 per cent compared to the previous six months while in the second half climbed 154 — a 40 per cent increase.
“The up-down-up nature of the deals in the last 18 months has largely mirrored our lives as we all rode the roller coaster of COVID-19,” Mr Face said.
“Technology is very strong in Queensland (up 18 per cent) and obviously mining but there was a massive drop in leisure from 41 transactions in 2019 to 18 last year.
“It is hard to remember a more interesting time in deal markets, as at the moment the uptick in late 2020 is carrying strongly into 2021.
“The consensus view at the moment seems to be that with a vaccine on the way, record stimulus and low interest rates, the upward roller coaster ride will continue.”
For the seventh year running, interstate buyers led the acquisition of Queensland businesses with 63 deals, comprising 36 per cent fall on 112 deals in 2019.
The number of international buyers slightly decreased again in 2020, with only 41 Queensland businesses transitioning to overseas ownership.
