BLOCKCHAIN start-up Pow­er Ledger has partnered with electricity retailer Powerclub in a deal to offer South Australian households greater control over their energy use.
The deal will allow Powerclub members with battery systems to pool and sell their excess solar and battery storage into a virtual power plant at times of high energy demand and price spikes.
Power Ledger co-founder Dr Jemma Green said Powerclub members would also gain access to wholesale electricity prices, providing more control and potential savings.
“The Australian Energy Market Commission has already flagged the need for grids of the future to become energy-trading platforms,” she said. “The future of the energy industry will be decentralised and democratised, like what we’ve seen happen to the taxi industry with rideshare apps.” Powerclub is a not-for-profit retailer that offers members access to wholesale electricity prices in exchange for an annual fee of $39.Powerclub founder Stuart McPherson said Power Ledger’s technology was “critical in reducing price opacity in the energy market”.
