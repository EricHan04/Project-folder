THE world is increasingly getting a taste for North Queensland produce.
Various projects and reports released in the past 12 months have indicated a positive return on investment into the vegetables and fruit-growing areas of the North.
A report released by Advance Cairns and the CRCNA earlier this year identified what is needed to grow international agricultural export opportunities from the Cairns Airport.
The report highlights the potential for agricultural exports including fruit, vegetables and beef, to double in value to $120 million over the next 10 years.
China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia have been named as stand-out markets.
Even corporate businesses are backing the region, with supermarket giant Coles recently opening a new 7280 square metre ripening facility in Melbourne specifically for North Queensland mangoes bananas and avocados, to keep up supply to its 270 supermarkets across Victoria and South Australia.
The North is also leading the way in other areas, including irrigation water management.
A pilot project which uses technology developed by young Australian company Civic Ledger and funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia (CRCNA), is seeing blockchain technology being trialled in the Mareeba-Dimbulah area, to improve water trading in the region. The system allows for an asset to be moved from person A to person B in a way that couldn't be duplicated and was visible to everyone in the market. It's hoped the technology will help irrigators trade between themselves allowing for better utilisation of the water that is available.
Meanwhile a detailed $10 million business case into the Lakeland Irrigation Scheme is underway after the Australian and Queensland governments signed a formal project agreement.
A feasibility study was completed early last year and found the proposed scheme had the potential to expand irrigated agriculture by about 8000 hectares.
