GIRLS are raking in pocket money in larger quantities than boys – but that’s because they are putting the work in around the house, clocking up 12 per cent more jobs than boys.
A national analysis of pocket money trends for kids aged seven to 14 finds girls are earning an average of 17c more than boys per pocket money payment, a difference of about 2 per cent or nearly $20 a year for teenagers.
Top jobs for children include tidying their room, making the bed and emptying the dishwasher.
Breaking down the data state-by-state, the snapshot by family finance fintech start-up Spriggy, finds kids in South Australia and Tasmania, earn the least while those in New South Wales are getting the most pocket money each week.
The data shows that kids’ pocket money rates have remained relatively flat year-on-year with an average a seven-year-old earning about $6.50 a week while a 12-year-old earns nearly $10 a week. “The data shows that (when it comes to pocket money) the gender pay gap is reversed … girls are more engaged in earning, spending and saving at a young age,” Spriggy’s Alice Brennan said.
