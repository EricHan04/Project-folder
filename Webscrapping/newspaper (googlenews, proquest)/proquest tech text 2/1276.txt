As authorities do not supply data on SACE achievement for individual schools, The Advertiser scoured dozens of school websites and Facebook pages to find those trumpeting their success after students received their results on Tuesday.
Almost all posted messages praising the resilience and determination of the Class of 2020 in the face of challenges posed by COVID-19.
Many were claiming 100 per cent of students eligible to complete their SACE had done so.
Schools choose to report to their communities on different measures. Common ones are SACE subject Merits, median ATARs, and numbers or proportions of students who achieve in various bands of the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank system.
Medians and percentages are more useful than raw numbers, because some schools have much larger Year 12 graduating cohorts than others.
Investigator College at Victor Harbor boasted 75 per cent of all grades were As or Bs and a quarter of its university aspirants achieved ATARs above 90.
Investigator’s head of senior school Belinda Delyster said the results were “truly excellent”. “In fact, our college’s results continue to rival those of the elite independent schools in capital cities,” she said. “Even more exciting is the fact that 80 per cent of those students wishing to attend university have already received early offers from the University of Adelaide and Flinders University.”
St Dominic’s Priory College said 93 per cent of all grades were As or Bs. At St Peter’s Girls School, 73 per cent of all grades were As. That was up from 66 per cent last year in a fourth consecutive year of improvement.
Some schools said they median ATARs in the high 80s. University Senior College had 13 students with ATARs above 99. Adelaide High School had 73 students with ATARS of 90-plus.
At Parafield Gardens High School, the dux was Sebastian Facchin-Young with an ATAR of 99.95, followed by Fares Elmore on 99.8.
Sebastian’s subject mix was strong in the sciences and he hopes to study medicine.
Year 12 was tough because he was at risk of coronavirus due to health conditions, forcing him to learn remotely for nearly three months as well as give up his job at Foodland.
“There was a lot of adjustment. I had to recognise that hey, I’m home but that doesn’t give me the excuse not to do anything,” he said.
It was now a “bittersweet” feeling, he said – parting on a high of success from the school that felt like a second home.
Fares wants to study computer science and artificial intelligence. A migrant from Egypt, he and his family hope to gain permanent residence.
“My dream is aviation and becoming a commercial pilot,” he said.
Some prominent schools offer the International Baccalaureate as well as the SACE, which affects results in several ways.
Firstly, high academic achievers often opt for the IB, which makes a school’s SACE results look weaker than they would otherwise be.
Secondly, IB results aren’t out yet until early January. When they arrive, it will alter schools’ final median ATARs. Also, some Year 12s do IB subjects and count them towards the SACE, so their SACE results aren’t yet finalised.
