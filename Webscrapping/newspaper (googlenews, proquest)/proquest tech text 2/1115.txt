IN a stroke of genius, paintings by Renaissance artists are being re-imagined in Wisdom of AI Light, the centrepiece of Illuminate Adelaide.
The multi-sensory experience, which is making its Australian premiere at the festival, is the vision of Istanbul-based Ouchhh Studio.
The exhibition is taking place in an 1000sq m purpose-built projection pavilion with a 9m-high ceiling on Rundle Rd in the East End.
There, famous artworks by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael will be beamed onto the floor, walls and ceiling to form a 3D sculpture.
But there’s a twist, Ouchhh Studio collected data – 15 billion brushstrokes from 20,000 Italian artworks – which were then fed into an artificial intelligence system to “learn” how to paint like the Renaissance artists.
As a result the iconic paintings projected in the space transform. Their particles disperse to create Renaissance-style moving images which have never existed before.
Those then morph into another well-known artwork and the cycle continues, also embracing other themes such as science and space.
It all happens to an evocative score by legendary classical composer Ludovico Einaudi.
“Wisdom of AI Light is a beautiful example of art and technology coming together to create an experience unlike any,” Illuminate Adelaide co-founder and so-creative director Rachael Azzopardi said. “You just need to come and experience it.” Wisdom of AI Light runs from Tuesday to Sunday. illuminateadelaide.com
