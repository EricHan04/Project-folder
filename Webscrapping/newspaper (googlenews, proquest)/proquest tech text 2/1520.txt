A MISMATCH still exists between the IT skills that companies need and those that workers hold.
Information technology has long been seen as a key employment competency but experts say skills shortages continue to plague Australian workplaces.
RMIT Online chief executive Helen Souness says data analysis is the most critical skill that workers lack, followed by digital literacy.
Advanced technology skills, including programming, cyber security and block chain, are also in high demand, while managers must improve their understanding of how technology can improve customer experiences and business processes, she says.
Souness says while workers and employers acknowledge the need for IT capabilities, not enough are upskilling in vital technologies.
“There’s a gap between where Australians are and where they want to be – which is very much in line with the skills we need as a nation to become a digital leader,” she says. “The bridge that helps us get from point A to point B is learning and, unfortunately, it hasn’t always been effective.’’ Research by RMIT Online has found three out of four Australians want to learn about emerging technologies, with more than half having little to no understanding of coding, block chain, artificial intelligence and data visualisation.
IT firm MuleSoft national vice- president Marc Caltabiano says all workers must have at least basic data literacy skills, as well as the ability to unlock and integrate data. “The current challenge ... is delivering digital projects more efficiently, while still meeting customers’ growing expectations for truly connected experiences,” he says. “However … only 36 per cent of organisations in Australia have the skills and technology to keep pace with digital projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.’’
