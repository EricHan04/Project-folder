THE board of Keith hospital has threatened to close services from today after the State Government rejected a plea for emergency funding.
It already injected $400,000 injection earlier this year, in addition to $1 million annual funding for the private, not-for-profit hospital.
Residents have resorted to crowd funding to keep the Emergency Department open, noting it is costing $2000 a day for GP locums. A public meeting will be held tonight.
Health and Wellbeing Minister Stephen Wade has refused to give more funds, saying the extra money was supposed to last until the end of the financial year and granting any more would not be fair to other country hospitals.
Tatiara Council Mayor Graham Excell wrote to Mr Wade asking the Government to increase annual funding by 50 per cent to $1.5 million and provide an immediate one-off boost of $240,000. Mr Wade responded that based on the more than 450 ED presentations last financial year, it would cost taxpayers around $3000 per ED presentation compared to the state average of $526.
“There is no public hospital in the state that is asking for a 50 per cent increase in its funding base from the taxpayers of this state,” Mr Wade wrote.He has asked the chair of the new Local Health Network Board, Grant King, to work with the Keith Hospital board to develop a sustainable medium to long term plan.
