GIRLS Rock! Adelaide has just begun a fundraising campaign to get girls to centre stage.
Throughout June and July, the organisation will raise money to host its annual, week-long music- mentoring program.
The campaign aims to raise $6000 to cover the costs associated with running the flagship Rock Camp event in 2022.
“We’re crowd-funding to cover costs for venue hire, catering, expertise, equipment and materials,” says co-director Sianne van Abkoude. “But we also need support to extend our wellbeing team and provide scholarships for young people who otherwise couldn’t afford to attend.
“We work hard each year to make sure no one is excluded from the experience because of financial barriers. So, hopefully, we’ll get lots of donors through this campaign.” This third iteration of Rock Camp will be in the July school holidays at Goodwood Community Centre.
