THE Naracoorte community has raised more than $40,000 for a court battle against plans for new workers’ accommodation at its former TAFE site, saying it will erode the Limestone Coast town’s character.
Neighbours Bronwyn Andrews and Alana Davies have launched proceedings in the Environment, Resources and Development Court to block the plan by Tony Dawson and his family to fit out the site’s current buildings with up to 88 bedrooms. Mrs Andrews said the money raised through crowd-funding showed large-scale support for the appeal, next in court on April 1.
Naracoorte Lucindale Council received more than 300 responses during community consultation on the development, with most raising concerns. In December, the council approved the Gordon St project, where workers would stay for a minimum of 28 days.Mr Dawson said a compromise plan, including 65 larger bedrooms over two floors, with extra toilets and showers was rejected by residents. He said the plan would address a “massive shortage” of workers’ accommodation in Naracoorte.
