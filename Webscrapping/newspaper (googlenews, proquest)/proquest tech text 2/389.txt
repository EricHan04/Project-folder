A pair of new red lentil varieties offered by start-up independent plant breeder Grains Innovation Australia (GIA) are set to offer growers a range of herbicide-tolerant options suited across Australia's lentil producing heartland of Victoria and South Australia.
GIA breeder Michael Materne, based in Horsham, said national variety trial (NVT) data showed the varieties stacked up well against industry benchmarks in a range of settings.
Dr Materne said the aim with one of the varieties, GIA Lightning, an imi-tolerant line, had been to provide growers in lower rainfall, sandy soil environments, such as the Mallee, a solid herbicide-tolerant option that could help them better incorporate a pulse within their broader crop rotation.
Janine Sounness, commercial manager at PBSeeds, the distributor of the new variety, said all available seed had already been sold to farmers across both South Australia and Victoria.
Another variety the fledgling breeder is excited about is GIA Thunder, which has consistently proved the top yielding imi-tolerant lentil across trials conducted by GIA and its research partners through Victoria and SA.
Recently released NVT data shows GIA Thunder's yield potential on average is 112pc of Hurricane XT across Victoria and South Australian trials over 2020 and 2021.
GIA are looking at more than just imi-tolerance in their portfolio, with two other new varieties, which will both be control released on a smaller-scale to allow further evaluation, featuring metribuzin and clopyralid tolerance respectively.
"Having varieties with these tolerances will allow farmers to have a solid herbicide rotation and not rely on the same group of chemicals and the associated potential risk of resistance," Dr Materne said.
These two varieties, GIA Metro and GIA Sire are world first in their types, being the first released varieties with a tolerance to metribuzin and clopyralid respectively.
