I’VE LIVED IN MY HOME...For 19 years. I live with my dog, Maddie.
MY HOME IS...
An early settlers’ cottage in North Adelaide.
I LOVE MY HOME BECAUSE...
It is a source of positive energy for me and a place where I can entertain friends and family. It’s small and easy to maintain and I have the CBD and North Adelaide at my doorstep. I love my new renovation. I recently knocked down the back of the house and built a new kitchen, two bathrooms and a bedroom suite upstairs.
BUT I STILL NEED TO...Replace the roof, gutters, front veranda and picket fence.
MY DECORATING STYLE Could be described as simple and modern. My home has a monochrome theme with splashes of silver and various shades of blue.
RECENT PURCHASE My new glass dining table that came from Italy through King Living.
I COLLECT...
Aboriginal artwork.
FAVOURITE ROOM My kitchen. I love the sleek black lines, silver cupboard doors that reflect the green ficus wall outside and the clever use of space. It makes cooking easy and enjoyable. I love that friends can sit at the kitchen bench and chat to me while I cook.
HOME FAVOURITES ● Gavin Wanganeen artwork.
● My Italian dining table.
● The black chandeliers in my living room and guest bedroom.
IN MY GARDEN I HAVE...
A lovely green courtyard with a great old world feel. My brother paved the courtyard with the original bricks from the house when I renovated.
WHEN I GET HOME AT NIGHT I FEED...
Maddie as she’s always hungry.
AT WEEKENDS I LIKE TO...
Dine out with friends, do a PT session or go for walks and relax. I love going to the Adelaide Hills for a Saturday late lunch and glass of wine.
MY FIRST CAR WAS...
An orange Volvo. My friends called it the flying pumpkin.
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO...Chillout music.
AT THE MOMENT I AM READING...
You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero.
FAVOURITE FILM The Breakfast Club.
CLEAN FREAK OR MESSY BESSIE?
A clean freak.
ON MY WISHLIST IS...
To travel. I always want to travel to new countries, learn new cultures and have new experiences.
WHEN I’M HOME I LIKE TO COOK...
Winter curries and summer barbecues. I’m a foodie.
FAV CAFE/RESTAURANT/BAR Ruby Red Flamingo (it’s around the corner). I have so many local favourites that are warm and welcoming.
FAVOURITE DRINK A glass of Pol Roger champagne. I love many local wines too.
WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WANTED TO...
Run an airport. I love airports.
FAVOURITE CHILDHOOD MEMORY Carefree summers down at Victor Harbor with extended family and friends. I love the feeling of summer.
IF I COULD CHANGE CAREER NOW I WOULD...Stick to being entrepreneurial, perhaps more focused on corporate advisory or commercial law.
FAVOURITE SA ACTIVITY I love the Tour Down Under, my house is always full of visitors and Adelaide is on the world stage.
DREAM HOLIDAY DESTINATIONIs to travel the Silk Road (after watching Joanna Lumley’s documentary).
FAVOURITE SPORTS TEAM The Adelaide Crows, but I’ll cheer on any South Australian team in any sport.
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS?
In the next 10 years I plan to be pivotal to the growth of South Australia. To build the economy, attract more visitors and raise our profile globally through business and board roles. I have a new start-up business in the pipeline.
MY NEIGHBOURS ARE...An extension of my house. They (the Jones family) are great friends and are always there when I need them. It’s a special friendship.
ICOULDN’T LIVE WITHOUT...
My friends and family; my passport and my connection to India.
IF I COULD AFFORD IT I WOULD LIVE...
In any house that had a large indoor and outdoor entertainment area. I would love my house to be a central place for friends and family to visit. It will always be in Adelaide.
HOME MEANS...Love and happiness (I’m a Cancerian).
