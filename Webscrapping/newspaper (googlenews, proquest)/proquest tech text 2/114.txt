THE Irwin family are taking their passion for wildlife conservation to the crypto world with the launch of its first non-fungible token (NFT) project.
In partnership with Australian technology start-up Meadow Labs, the rare NFT project will consist of a series of digital artworks the public can buy.
Each artwork will focus on a different Australia Zoo “Wildlife Warriors” animal. The project will raise awareness and funds to protect Australia’s wildlife and wild places, a cause close to the Irwin family’s heart.
An NFT is a digital asset stored on a digital ledger (blockchain) that can be sold or traded. Each token, which can take different forms including an image or video, is uniquely identifiable. However, unlike Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, NFTs cannot be replicated.
Robert Irwin, who helps run the family business with his sister Bindi and mum Terri, said the new venture would help continue their “Wildlife Warriors mission”. “Any innovation that can help our conservation efforts, particularly one that shares our vision of protecting the planet, is something we’re thrilled to support,” he said.
