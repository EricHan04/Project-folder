DIAMONDS coach Lisa Alexander says Netball Australia could not have punished Maria Folau for publicly supporting sacked Wallabies star husband Israel, but stresses the sport she represents is fiercely inclusive.
New Zealand and Adelaide Thunderbirds sharpshooter Folau has come under fire for endorsing Israel’s crowd-funding efforts in his legal fight against Rugby Australia, which terminated his contract over his latest homophobic social media post claiming “hell awaits” gay people.
Netball Australia, Super Netball and the Thunderbirds determined Folau’s Instagram post had not breached their social media policy and she would therefore not be sanctioned. Australian netball legend Liz Ellis slammed the decision as “not good enough”.
Alexander was more diplomatic, submitting her employer had little choice. “I just don’t think they can,” Alexander said. “That’s a part of what everyone has to understand, and that’s why Netball Australia really came out to say that they know that there is nothing there in the [contractual stipulations].
“And also that we do support inclusivity, we are absolutely for it. “We’re not the sport that’s having to deal with Israel — Rugby Australia are — but we have made it very clear that we’re an inclusive sport and that we want everyone to enjoy our game no matter what race, religion, sexual orientation, the whole bit.” Folau is staying silent on the issue as she prepares for the Silver Ferns’ Netball World Cup campaign, starting in Liverpool on Friday.Netball New Zealand last week said Folau had “not breached NNZ policy”.
