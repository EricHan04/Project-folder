Global defence giant Lockheed Martin has opened a second office in Adelaide, employing close to 100 staff researching artificial intelligence and hypersonics technology.
The new office, on Pirie St in the CBD, includes a “STELaRLab” research facility that was first opened outside the US in Melbourne in 2016.
At the facility, scientists and engineers will develop new technology in artificial intelligence, autonomy, hypersonics and other hi-tech fields.
Lockheed Martin Australia chief executive Warren McDonald said the opening of the second office was “a testament” of the company’s “resolute commitment to the region”.
The global defence juggernaut first opened offices in SA, at Mawson Lakes, in 2003. Employee numbers have grown from 300 in 2018 to more than 520 today. Defence and Space Industries Minister Susan Close said Lockheed Martin had been responsible for boosting SA’s sovereign workforce by creating “exciting job opportunities for skilled workers”.
