WHAT IS ATS SOFTWARE, AND DOES YOUR ORGANISATION USE IT?
LISA MORRIS DIRECTOR, HAYS Anybody who works in recruitment will likely have an ATS, or applicant tracking system. Most people are aware that one job ad can elicit hundreds of responses. All must be screened to identify the suitable candidates to shortlist. With the aid of an ATS, this time-consuming process can be dramatically reduced. An important aspect of an ATS is CV parsing. The software uses a preliminary scan to analyse a candidate’s skills, experience, education and even job titles.
JUSTIN HINORA EXECUTIVE CONSULTANT, HENDER CONSULTING Used appropriately and not exclusively to assess candidate suitability, applicant tracking software can be a useful way of electronically tracking applicants, assist with workflow and compliance and can sift through top applicants to reduce time-to-hire while still finding quality candidates. However, there is no substitute for an experienced human to determine candidate suitability. We use cloud-based software which is both an ATS and CRM system.
ANDREW SULLIVAN MANAGING DIRECTOR, SULLIVAN CONSULTING ATS is a tool recruiters use throughout the recruitment process. Essentially, it’s a database that stores candidate information in a way that’s helpful for managing each stage of recruitment. We use ATS software to help things run smoothly. It allows us to see candidates alongside the job they’ve applied for and track each candidate’s progress across the various stages, such as first and second-round interviews through to reference and qualification checking.
ALEXANDRA ROSSER HEAD OF ORGANISATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY CONSULTING, STILLWELL MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS ATS is designed to assist recruiters and hirers to manage candidate and client data in a central location. It typically has integrations with calendars, time sheets, pay details, job boards, etc. Some organisations use its semi sophisticated AI to match candidates to job ads but we believe the technology still has a way to go to be useful in this function.
