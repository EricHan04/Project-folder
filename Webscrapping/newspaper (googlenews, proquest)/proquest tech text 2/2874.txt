THE distressed father of a young woman who fell to her death has been dealt another blow after Adelaide went into lockdown, preventing him from attending her funeral.
Mariah Huthmann Grace, a mother of six, fell from the 22nd floor of an apartment in Surfers Paradise on Tuesday. Police have confirmed the 28-year-old mother’s death was being treated as non-suspicious.
John Grace (inset with Mariah) is trapped in Adelaide’s six-day lockdown and unable to return to Queensland.
“Even if I made it to Queensland, I’d be in lockdown up there for two weeks at my own expense, which I can’t afford,” he said. “I can’t ask my kids or their mother to hold out almost a month for me, I don’t see that as being right. I’m lost.” Mariah was the third-youngest of Mr Grace’s seven children. He hopes to be able to watch the “tangi”, a traditional Maori funeral, online. “As long as my daughter gets a great send-off, I’ll be happy,” he said.
“It’s pretty devastating, the loss of father, mother, son or daughter, but then, not being allowed to attend their funeral is heartbreaking in itself.
“The stress and strain can be too much sometimes.” A crowd-funding page, with a target of $10,000, was set up on Thursday by Mariah’s sister Che to cover the funeral costs, with $860 raised in the first hour. “We are absolutely devastated by Mariah’s passing and are struggling to find the funds to cover the cost of her funeral," she wrote. Che wrote that no funeral arrangements had been made.
