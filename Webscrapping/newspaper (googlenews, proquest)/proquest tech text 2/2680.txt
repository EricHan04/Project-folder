COLES is not disheartened by workers turning their backs on the nation’s CBDs to work more from home and will ramp up its rollout of smaller, Coles Local stores.
A Coles Local store opened in York Street, Sydney, yesterday, the supermarket giant’s first new store to open in the city’s CBD in 15 years.
It will then roll out a store in Melbourne’s inner-city Fitzroy and in the Brisbane suburb of Ascot, which will be Queensland’s first Local store.
Coles chief sustainability, property and export officer Thinus Keeve said the local community stores could thrive in the COVID era.
“We remain positive about specific micro areas within parts of the CBD,” he said.
Coles is backing up that belief by making a play for the inner-city and local shopping community with a decision to accelerate the innovation of its small-store formats. “We are ramping it up,” Mr Keeve said of the Coles Local concept.
The new Coles Local in Sydney, at 833sq m, is slightly smaller than a normal Coles supermarket, with the retailer employing data analytics to tailor about 4700 product lines to a customised store layout for the CBD customer.
For a long time, rival Woolworths has had a grip on the inner-city and CBD shopping community with its small-format stores, and there has also been a range of smaller convenience stores operated by independent retailers.
However, with COVID-19 keeping many office workers at home and CBDs struggling to attract them back, it could be a tough sell until vaccines are fully rolled out. “From a Coles perspective, we think things will change and some things will stay the same. Flexibility is here to stay,” Mr Keeve said. “And we see that in our customers and this (Coles Local) offer caters towards that.” Coles shares fell 13c to $16.27 yesterday.
