SYDNEY’S celeb circles were definitely not taking the new relationship between a cult beauty brand and social media star Celeste Barber at face value yesterday, if the heaving early morning crowd at a Rose Bay event was anything to go by.
Catalina was packed at 9am for the event put on by MCoBeauty to celebrate their partnership with actor Barber, who has already got Hollywood icon Sharon Stone to use the brand’s famous $17 mascara. Actor Hugh Sheridan, TV presenter Jules Sebastian and top sports host Erin Molan were among the more than 120 there, with the brand’s chief executive Shelley Sullivan saying that no one on the glitzy invite list failed to RSVP. “Do you know how many times we’ve tried to host an event over the last year,” said Sullivan.
In an ironic twist, the event was also filled with leading beauty influencers, an Insta-industry Barber has made a career of poking fun at.
“I don’t have anything against (influencers) but I’m not one,” Barber quipped, before later adding: “Now Sharon Stone uses the mascara, so, who cares?” It’s been a profitable partnership for MCoBeauty with sales increasing by 500 per cent in Woolworths after Barber aligned with the beauty brand, bringing an additional 1.5 million new customers into the supermarket chain.
Sheridan also rushed out of rehearsals for Hughman, his show for the Adelaide Fringe, to attend the event: “Shelley and I have known each other since I was at NIDA and she was a single mum trying to start up her brand in her garage.” Confidential P21
