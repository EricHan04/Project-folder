HUMAN-LIKE robots that literally raise an eyebrow, smartphones that fold out three times over and cars that change colour.
These were some of the futuristic innovations that made their debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Thursday.
One standout was an expressive humanoid robot created by British firm Engineered Arts.
The robot, known as Ameca, uses artificial intelligence and "artificial body” technology to form realistic human expressions.
Meanwhile, Samsung’s display division revealed four new folding screen prototypes.
And BMW unveiled a vehicle that changes colour. The BMW iX Flow SUV features an exterior co-developed with E Ink – the technology used in Amazon Kindle screens – that lets drivers change the colour of their cars at the touch of a button.
