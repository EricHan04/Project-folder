ACQUISITIONS INTERNET services provider Uniti Group has gained a significant share of the national broadband infrastructure market through its latest acquisition.
It will pay $140m for Telstra’s fibre assets that make up the Telstra Velocity and South Brisbane exchange network.
Velocity is Telstra’s optical fibre network that uses fibre to the premise (FTTP) technology to deliver high-speed broadband, phone and payphone, subscription TV and free-to-air services across 128 housing estates on the mainland.
About 68,000 premises have access to the Velocity FTTP network in these estates and regions. Uniti is also finalising two November deals – a $700m buyout of OptiComm and the $9.25m Harbour ISP purchase.
Uniti has gone from a loss-making start-up to a juggernaut since its ASX listing in February 2019, which also included the sacking of founders Che Metcalfe and Sasha Baranikov.
The transaction with Telstra is a complex arrangement that will see Uniti, which has a market capitalisation of $931m, take on fresh capital-raising and debt. The deal will push its market value closer to $1bn.
Uniti will pay $85m on transaction completion – $20m payable in three instalments over three years and $35m on completing the migration of the assets, subject to an adjustment based on active services.
Uniti said the deal would be 13 per cent earnings per share accretive from next year and would increase FY21 pro-forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by more than 20 per cent to $116m. Chief executive Michael Simmons said yesterday the Velocity acquisition was “another remarkable milestone for our young company”. “To have secured such a large FTTP network … is a wonderful way to end what has been a completely transformative year for Uniti Group,” he said.
