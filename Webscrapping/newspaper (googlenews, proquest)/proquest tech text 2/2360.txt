Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions. These are recorded in a digital ledger called a blockchain. Hackers can steal Bitcoins by gaining access to the owners’ digital wallets.
Despite being a legitimately traded commodity, a lack of oversight from regulators and its use by criminals has meant that cryptocurrencies have become synonymous with cyber crime.
How to avoid scams: • Never agree to receive and transfer funds to another account. • Seek out the public identity of the company you are engaging with. • Be cautious with any site or software promising a fixed gain. • Be certain of the person/product you are engaging with as the transactions are almost all irreversible.
• Ensure you have adequate protection on your devices through which you conduct any activity involving cryptocurrencies.
• Do plenty of research and engage widely first. Simply searching the name with ‘reviews’ may identify a scam. Source: IDCare
