AN idea born in a classroom that could help pregnant women worldwide has won two young students a national award.
St Peter’s Girls’ School Year 10 students Jenna Bowden and Edie McKellar took out first prize in the national Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Good Challenge.
Their concept of an AI midwife to educate and monitor pregnant women wowed the judges.
Jenna, 15, says the pair liked the idea of designing an AI midwife specifically for use in remote communities or developing countries.
“The AI midwife itself is to educate people maybe where they’re lacking that education on pregnancy in remote areas,” Jenna, of Athelstone, says.
“A lot of remote communities or countries have a high mortality rate for pregnancy and childbirth, so there’s a real need for this type of education.” Two months of planning and design culminated in a trip to Sydney to present their idea to the national judges. Edie, of Highbury, says knowing they were designing something for a good cause made the hard work worthwhile.
“We had to work hard to get it all done and make sure our idea was really clear to the judges,” Edie, 16, says.
“I think the main part for me was that we could use AI to come up with an idea that would do good and have an impact on the world.“It could really make a massive impact on so many lives and really become part of our future.”
