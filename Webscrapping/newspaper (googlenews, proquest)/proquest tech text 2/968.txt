There’s a lot happening in South Australia these days. In the CBD, the site of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital is being transformed into an innovative neighbourhood that will house the jobs of tomorrow. In our regions, space is exploring a new frontier while migrant workers are bringing life to country towns. And then there’s the magical adventures you can only experience in SA. You just might not know about them ... yet
It’s going to be one of the most anticipated events of the year when the boards come down and Lot Fourteen is finally revealed
Watch this space – over the next 6-12 months, the scaffolding will be coming down and the public will be invited in. This is Lot Fourteen, the new showcase of how South Australia is creating the jobs of the future.
In the years ahead, the public will visit the site to watch Australian satellite launches from Mission Control, take in a Fringe show, absorb the works on display at the Aboriginal Art and Cultures Gallery or simply enjoy a great meal or relaxing drink with friends.
“It’s an investment for the future,” presiding member of the Urban Renewal Authority Board Con Tragakis says. “It is the largest, most exciting development site in the southern hemisphere. There’s a lot of thought gone into how it’s being repurposed.” Tragakis, a former managing partner at professional services firm KPMG, took over as head of the board which governs Renewal SA last month. Renewal SA, the urban development arm of government, is leading the Lot Fourteen project at the site of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital. Backed by State, federal and local government and already open for business, Lot Fourteen is fast taking shape.
Premier Steven Marshall says the site is bringing together internationally significant tenants – such as the Australian Space Agency – to rub shoulders with young entrepreneurs and creative thinkers. “It has the potential to drive massive investment, new jobs and business creation as well as providing a real focal point for visitors,” he says. “The major focal point will be an innovation and entrepreneurship precinct for space, defence, cyber, machine learning and future industries.
Our plan is to have close to 1000 people working there this year and, ultimately, more than 6000 on the site.” Lot Fourteen has already brought in companies and organisations in its targeted sectors of space and defence, cyber security and data analytics, atificial intelligence and creative industries. The site also is home to organisations which will co-ordinate and nurture new companies. SA’s chief entrepreneur, Jim Whalley, has established his office in Lot Fourteen and is playing a key role in curating who will set up their business on the site. Stone and Chalk, which has successfully established start-up hubs in Sydney and Melbourne, is now recruiting in Adelaide to build a similar hub at Lot Fourteen.
A big data Living Lab is being established in a joint venture with the world-leading university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bank SA will be principal partner of the Living Lab, providing sponsorship support. Optus Business, and sister mobility intelligence company DSpark, will provide technical capability, including fitting out the Living Lab space.
The companies will provide and use de-identified and aggregated data for research aimed at driving economic growth and population increase.
Tragakis is convinced Lot Fourteen will act as a “catalyst for capital” because potential investors from interstate and overseas will be visiting Adelaide in greater numbers than before to collaborate with businesses in the neighbourhood. One of the chronic obstacles faced by growing companies in SA has been the lack of local capital to help businesses step up to the next level. In future, Tragakis sees businesses introducing their neighbours on Lot Fourteen to new sources of capital. It will also give a boost to the businesses in the vicinity.
“The East End of Adelaide needs an economic multiplier,” he says. “There’s been a lot of investment with the Adelaide Oval, new Royal Adelaide Hospital, SAHMRI and expansions of the universities, so Lot Fourteen is an amazing bookend to North Tce.” The Adelaide Oval redevelopment has created an economic benefit of $330 million a year and created more than 1000 jobs, says Barry Burgan from Economic Research Consultants who has presented research to State Parliament by the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority. The Government expects Lot Fourteen to have a similar or stronger multiplier effect on the economy.
A report by a former economic development minister of New Zealand, Steven Joyce, recommended the Government look to sectors with the most potential. “SA’s future prosperity will be built by accelerating the growth of sectors that have strong growth prospects globally and in which the state has a comparative advantage,” he says. “This requires a concerted increase in private sector investment and trade, and requires concentrated effort from the Government to remove barriers to growth.
“SA has a number of comparative advantages in the hi-tech sector. These include its links to the defence and space technology industries, its hosting of the Australian Institute of Machine learning, and Adelaide’s commitment to becoming Australia’s first Gig-city – with broadband at 10 gigabits/second available at 14 locations across the city. The state also has a number of innovation districts, including Tonsley Innovation District, Osborn Technology Park and Lot Fourteen.
“Lot Fourteen has the potential to be a major enabler for the sector, with its focus on entrepreneurialism, the defence and space sectors, and the creative industries, and its proximity to the main university campuses.” The demolition project at Lot Fourteen is one of the most significant projects of its kind Australia-wide, being delivered over a series of stages, with a cost of approximately $150 million. Major refurbishments are now being undertaken of six out of the seven heritage buildings at Lot Fourteen – the McEwin, Allied Health, Women’s Health, Margaret Graham, Sheridan and Eleanor Harrald buildings. These will be completed by the end of this year. The Bice Building will be completed by the end of 2020 and will have capacity to accommodate up to 300 people bringing the total population across the heritage buildings to 1000 people.
“The heritage buildings are looking absolutely fantastic and will be a showcase for tech, innovation and entrepreneurs,” Tragakis says.
The demolition of the obsolete buildings is expected to be completed by late 2020, with construction of the landmark Innovation Centre commencing soon after as well as providing space to build the proposed Aboriginal Art and Cultures Centre and International Centre for Food, Hospitality and Tourism Studies. The Renewal SA Board has seen conceptual drawings and positioning statements about the Innovation Centre which will house start-ups from a variety of sectors. “It’s super exciting,” Tragakis says. “It will be open to the community and be there to enthuse the next generation to get involved in entrepreneurship and innovation.” The ownership structure and architectural concepts for the tower will be considered by the board. “Teaming with the private sector is incredibly important,” he says.
Two companies Tragakis chairs – home loan provider Tic Toc and real estate intelligence company PointData – are investigating moving into Lot Fourteen. They are typical of companies at the cutting edge of technology which want to benefit from the collaborative culture being built at Lot Fourteen. These companies are creating new jobs in areas which demand high-level skills and therefore justified high-wage positions. “We have the opportunity to attract young people who have left SA back home,” Tragakis says. “And, importantly, we have the opportunity to attract global talent. And then people with these highly sought-after skills feed off each other. We will incubate that talent here through using property and infrastructure.” As well as other like-minded businesses in the precinct, companies were drawn by Lot Fourteen’s proximity to the Adelaide Botanic Garden and retail, food and drink outlets of the East End and cultural establishments, particularly the new Aboriginal Art and Cultures Gallery to be built on the site.
