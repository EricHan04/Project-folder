FORMER foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop has picked up her first major corporate job since her political exit last year.
Ms Bishop recently joined Greensill Capital, headed by one of Australia’s youngest billionaires, London-based Lex Greensill and his brother Peter, The Australian reports.
The former senior Liberal, who was born in Lobethal in the Adelaide Hills, has assumed the role of non-executive chairwoman and will also join the $5.8 billion company’s global advisory board.
She will also continue to operate her consulting firm Julie Bishop & Partners while working at Greensill, a fast-growing supply chain finance company which is considering a stockmarket float later this year.
Ms Bishop will help the company’s expansion into Asia.
“Business, government and individuals can all benefit from greater efficiencies in the finance sector,” Ms Bishop said on Thursday, according to The Australian.
Mr Greensill said he was pleased Ms Bishop had joined his company. “The ability to draw on Julie’s unparalleled experience and expertise – particularly her international credentials cemented during five years as Australia’s foreign minister – will be invaluable,” he said.
Since quitting politics at last year’s May federal election, Ms Bishop has also taken an advisory board role for US artificial intelligence group Affiniti.
She became chancellor of the Australian National University and is a director with international development consultancy, Palladium.
The news comes as outgoing US ambassador and former federal treasurer Joe Hockey revealed his plans to stay in the US. Mr Hockey told Nine newspapers he plans to stay in Washington for several years even if Donald Trump loses this year’s US presidential election.
He told the media outlet he planned to work in the private sector when his ambassadorship ends.
“This is the modern Rome,” Hockey said of Washington.“We’re going through a tumultuous period and I want to be in the thick of it.”
