THE Defence Department has signed over the storage of its secrets to a Chinese-owned company in apparent defiance of orders from the Federal Government.
For years, data storage firm Global Switch has stored the nation’s military secrets at ­ Ultimo in inner Sydney.
But that was set to change after its London-based parent company Aldersgate Investments sold a 49 per cent stake to a Chinese data tech consortium five years ago.
The change was to come when the contract ended in October last year, but a new contract tendered to Federal Parliament yesterday ­revealed it was instead ­extended to September 2025.
The quiet re-signing came at a cost of $53.5m, about $300,000 more than the original quote, despite the then treasurer and now Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, saying in 2017 that Defence would shift all of its data to an Australian-owned hub by 2020. Defence confirmed it had extended its property lease of the data storage. MPs Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie are calling for the immediate ­termination of all data storage contracts with foreign-owned entities.
