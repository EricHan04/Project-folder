TRANSPORT AN AUSTRALIAN start-up which rose to fame by supplying gig economy workers with a subscription-based e-bicycle service has axed 16 per cent of its staff.
Zoomo chief executive Mina Nada announced the lay-offs in a letter to staff this week, in which he blamed the economy as the reason for laying off staff. The cuts are thought to impact around 65 of the company’s workers. “A year ago, we could not keep up with demand, supply chain was snarled and capital was abundant. We made decisions in line with our environment,” Mr Nada (pictured) wrote. “Fast forward to today, and we’re witnessing an increasingly challenging macro-economic environment with increased risks of softened demand and tighter capital. That requires an adjustment in our strategy and cost-base.” Mr Nada said Zoomo would hit the brakes on its global expansion plans and shifted its focus toward becoming profitable.
