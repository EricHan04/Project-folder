INVESTING AUSTRALIA’S crowd-funding industry doubled in size over the past 12 months, according to new figures from the industry’s largest player, Birchal.
Crowd-funding has become the go-to funding source for Australia’s most exciting small businesses and start-ups, according to Birchal managing director and co-founder Matt Vitale, who said the sector was the strongest it had ever been.
“Given the current lockdowns across the country, it seems we will be feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic for some time. However, the new financial year has started with strong activity,” he said.
“Ten successful CSF (crowd-sourced funding) offers have raised $7.8m on Birchal in July so far, which makes us confident that the industry will continue to grow.” Overall, 63 successful CSF offers were completed over the year – up 40 per cent on the previous year – raising a total of $47m, a 100 per cent increase. One of the most successful was the start-up Thrive. It raised $1m in just under three hours and smashed its $3m target in record time.
