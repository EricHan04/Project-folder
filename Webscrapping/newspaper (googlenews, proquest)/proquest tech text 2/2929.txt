IT’s been a week since family and friends of former Logan police sergeant Rachel Whitford paid their last respects at a packed-out funeral service. But still the anguish remains.
Ms Whitford, 48, had been on a trip of a lifetime to catch up with family and friends in South Australia, when she died in a light aeroplane after flying over Lake Eyre.
Her body was flown back to Brisbane after a crowd funding campaign. More than 500 people attended the full requiem mass at Mary Immaculate Church at Annerley on Wednesday last week, most still in shock after her sudden death.
Police, many from Logan where she served in a variety of roles including at the PCYC, formed a guard of honour as the hearse left the church following the service by Fr Andrew Wise.
The Adelaide-born mother, was on an action-packed few days of fun, travel and friends in South Australia’s Far North, leaving at home in Brisbane, her husband Cameron and their five children.
Despite battling travel sickness and recovering from a near-miss on a similar flight a month earlier, the retired police sergeant was overjoyed at seeing a spectacular, water-filled Lake Eyre from the air. But in a tragic twist that has left a trail of grief across two states, she made a last-minute decision to change planes as she flew between Marree, William Creek and Leigh Creek on July 6.
Ms Whitford’s sister-in-law Jody Koerner said her family was immensely proud of her award-winning achievements, especially her husband, of Wynnum, who she met working at a supermarket aged 15 — as well as children Jacob, 21, Abbè-May, 20, Madeline, 18, Lauren, 16, and 15 year-old Nicholas.Ms Whitford’s Adelaide-based parents, Peter, 83 — a former SANFL great — and Geraldine, 80, as well as her three remaining siblings are grief-stricken.
