KATHRYN Ingler often finds it easier to focus on work at a cafe rather than at home.
”When you’re working from home, there are always things to distract you – like throwing a load of washing on or going to the post office or you just see other things and think you should be doing that when really you should be working,” Ingler says.
“I take my noise-cancelling headphones to a cafe and do a lot of different focus work, a lot of typing and admin work. It’s a fair bit more effective (working) at a cafe (than home).” Ingler, who works remotely as a senior account executive with Sydney digital design start-up Qwilr, conducts most of her work calls from home, where she prefers the quieter environment.
But she also works from her local cafes two or three times a week, staying about two hours each visit.
“It’s not an obnoxiously long amount of time,” she says. “It’s long enough that I can sit down, get focused and smash out a bunch of work.” Ingler is now “pals” with the barista of the cafe closest to her home and staff are familiar with her regular order of coffee, juice and a pastry.
She often tells her boss when she is working at a cafe and says there has never been a problem. “Some people have the option to go into their home office (to work) but I live in a one-bedroom apartment, so it’s a nice change of scenery,” she says.
