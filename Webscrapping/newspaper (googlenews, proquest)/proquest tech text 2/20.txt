TECHNOLOGY AUSTRALIAN billion dollar social media start-up Linktree is laying off nearly 20 per cent of its workforce, the latest casualty in what is quickly becoming a bloodbath for the local technology sector.
Linktree, based in Melbourne and Sydney, was most recently valued at $1.78bn and is one of the top 300 most popular websites globally with 1.2 billion monthly views, growing from a simple “link in bio” page for influencers to a platform enabling brands, artists and businesses to monetise their content through social media. Linktree is thought to have around 280 employees, with the 17 per cent figure representing about 48 staff.
Start-up valuations have come under pressure recently amid a broader market rout, forcing several local software firms to shut down or lay off staff. “For a company like ours, so focused on culture and camaraderie, this will be difficult news,” said co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria in a letter to staff. “Today’s change to our team ... puts us in a strong position to deliver on the opportunity we have in front of us.”
