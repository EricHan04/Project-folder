TECHNOLOGY FORMER Jetstar boss Bruce Buchanan’s tech unicorn Rokt has smashed the record for the largest single venture capital raise in Australian history.
He raised $458m in Series E funding as the start-up’s valuation nears $3bn ahead of a US initial public offering.
The Lachlan Murdoch-backed Rokt – now worth $2.75bn – closed the funding round led by Tiger Global, with existing investors including AustralianSuper and Hostplus also pouring money into the e-commerce business.
Mr Buchanan said the raise represented a “coming of age” moment for both Rokt and Australian tech start-ups more broadly.
“Australian businesses can now go to the biggest funds in the world and say ‘we are producing a product that is relevant to the whole planet’,” he said.
Mr Buchanan said Rokt would use new funding to invest in R&D, international expansion and strategic acquisitions ahead of a US initial public offering, likely in 2023.
More than 3000 brands now use the company’s e-commerce technology, which connects advertisers through partners’ websites to new digital online and mobile consumers. A customer searching for a hotel in a particular city might be shown a relevant deal for nearby parking, for example.
“I think the most likely place we’ll list is in the US, just given the proximity to our customers and revenue base,” Mr Buchanan said.
“This raise definitely opens up that market for us.” Mr Buchanan said following the funding round’s closure that his most pressing challenge was the ongoing war for tech talent.
“It’s very competitive, especially in highly specialised R&D roles,” he said. “Big tech businesses are now trying to stock up on as many smart people as they can.” Rokt employs 400 staff.
