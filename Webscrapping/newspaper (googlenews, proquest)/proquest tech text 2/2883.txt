Italy via Woolloomooloo David Smiedt / Lists Editor Italian-Australian cuisine royalty Mario Percuoco’s new Il Pontile on Cowper Wharf in Sydney’s Woolloomooloo leans deliciously towards seafood. The kingfish crudo is sublime, but the char-grilled king prawns with gremolata are even better. And just quietly, this precinct offers some of the best people-watching in Sydney.
Christmas by the book Kerrie McCallum / Editor-in-Chief Christmas is just around the corner and I’m already feeling festive after reading designer Collette Dinnigan’s new picture book, Santa Loves Australia. Beautifully illustrated by award-winning artist Luke Sciberras, it’s a gorgeous way to show Aussie kids what Santa thinks of our glorious land, and follows his journey from Uluru to the Great Barrier Reef. A must for any family bookshelf.
Good times Baz Goodwin / Creative Director The homegrown Melbourne Watch Company, launched in 2013 through crowd-funding, offers a tip of the hat to Victoria with each of its models. I like the Portsea Calendar Navy, the company’s modern take on a “deck watch”. Best of all, its watches are designed and assembled in the heart of the city. You could say it’s a little (time) piece of Melbourne on your wrist.
Celebrity power Jana Frawley / Content Director Brand-new liner Celebrity Apex has just completed its inaugural sailing and I’m obsessed. Goop and Gwyneth Paltrow are its new well-being advisers, the fitness classes are brought to you by Peloton and F45, and the spa treatments are cleverly called “Ahh-Inspiring”. A week or three on board is the perfect vitality boost after nearly two years without setting sail.
