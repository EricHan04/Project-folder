A REBUILT Thomas Foods faces a major challenge securing enough staff to fill its mammoth new facility at Murray Bridge, the company’s chief executive says.
Darren Thomas, pictured, said once the rebuild was complete, Thomas Foods could process 30 per cent more sheep at the Murray Bridge site and between 30 to 40 per cent more cattle. Before the fire that destroyed its complex in January last year, Thomas Foods was processing between 1000 to 1200 cattle a day and about 11,000 sheep and lambs. As the processing rate increases, finding the right staff will be a major focus for the company. The new facility, expected to be in production late next year, will employ 400 people initially, growing to 2000.
“It’s incredibly hard to get labour (in the red meat industry), it’s the single hardest issue we’re going to face,” Mr Thomas said yesterday at the Agribusiness Australia annual CEO lunch at the National Wine Centre.
He said that with the new plant harnessing the latest technology, it was not just securing manual labour that would be an issue, but finding expertise in a range of areas.
“We’re going to need computer programmers and we’re going to need people with artificial intelligence experience,” he said. Giving the industry an image overhaul would go a long way to attracting staff.“Instead of the local school principal saying ‘if you don’t concentrate in school, you’ll end up at the meat works’ we need to promote the incredible career paths that are available,” he said.
