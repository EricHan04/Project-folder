ONE in two marketing professionals are concerned about a digital skills shortage as artificial intelligence, social customer service and automation become important technologies for the industry.
A survey of more than 200 executive and senior marketing professionals by the Digital Marketing Institute finds the digital marketing budgets increased for all of them in the past two years, and now accounts for 55 per cent of their budget.
However, 53 per cent are concerned about a digital skills shortage and 47 per cent struggle with the evolving digital landscape, which ranges from display advertising, organic social media and apps for mobile use and video content.
Skills gaps are greatest in marketplace selling, search engine optimisation and organic social media.
Staff training was cited by 83 per cent of respondents as being key to upskilling and reskilling marketing teams.
Chief executive Ken Fitzpatrick says having the right skills is going to be just as important in the digitisation of marketing as having increased budgets and effective strategies.“As digital technologies rapidly transform business, marketers are recognising the need to invest more resources in training and closing skills gaps,” he says. “There is an urgency to cultivate a talent pool that possesses the skills necessary to help their organisations remain competitive and relevant in the digital economy.”
