ADELAIDE’s Illuminate Festival will spawn a permanent piece of public art in the city centre, with construction to start next month.
The work, to which Adelaide City Council will contribute $300,000, will be designed by Illuminate’s artist-in-residence Ouchhh Studios.
Ouchhh is an Istanbul-based creative studio that combines artificial intelligence and art to create large-scale public displays.
Over the past decade, Ouchhh has created more than 50 such displays in Europe, North America and Asia.
The concept and location will be decided in July but Illuminate co-founder Lee Cumberlidge said the permanent installation would be a “legacy” for the festival. Ouchhh’s spectacular Wisdom of AI Light show launches on July 16 in a purpose-built venue on Rundle Rd.
