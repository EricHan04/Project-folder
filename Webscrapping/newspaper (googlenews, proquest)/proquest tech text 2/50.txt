IT’S not rocket science; a start-up in Adelaide can have a global impact and help save the planet at the same time. Actually, it sort of is because Flavia Tata Nardini is a rocket scientist as well as being the chief executive of Adelaide’s Fleet Space Technologies.
Nardini (below, centre) was a speaker at this week’s Vogue Codes in Conversation breakfast event at Fishbank.
She shared the stage with Sydneysider The Yield chief executive Ros Harvey (below,left) and Vogue Australia editor-in-chief Edwina McCann (below, right).
Nardini, who has been on a mission to make South Australia the country’s biggest satellite manufacturer, explained how the technology can dramatically reduce environmental impact in the mining industry.
For example, satellites are used to locate lithium deposits to enable targeted rather than haphazard, hit-and-miss drilling.
Adelaide-born Kit Bashford,from event sponsor Audi Australia, welcomed the guests, who included Palas Jewellery CEO and designer Anna Dimond, Kara Fantasia from Port Adelaide Football Club, influencer Sam Costello, Rundle Mall Management Authority’s Johanna Williams and Fiona Krawczyk from Haigh’s Chocolates. The Vogue Codes national talk series was founded by Vogue Australia in 2016 to encourage more women to seek careers in the technology industry.
