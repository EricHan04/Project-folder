Nick Smyth has joined Biostart as forage preservatives sales manager, based in South Australia, to provide advice and support to farmers and growers looking to maximise their fodder preservation and lift hay and silage quality.
Mr Smyth said he had no hesitation in joining the Biostart team.
"I have had prior experience with BioStart's biological fodder products, HayKing and SilageKing," he said.
"I know they reliably create good hay and silage.
"They are also easy to use and keep the temperature of bales down.
"One of the things customers like about SilageKing and HayKing is that they can take a break for a couple of days and start up again without having to throw away the rest of the product.
"That means no wastage and you can work out the amount of forage you have made from your in-cab monitor."
HayKing advantages include:
Inhibits spoilage moulds and yeasts;
Does not contain live bacteria;
Safe and easy to apply;
Suitable for domestic and export hay - nil witholding;
Reduces losses in dry matter and quality;
Increases baling window;
Can be used with hay steamers; and
Been used for more than 10 years in Australia.
SilageKing advantages include:
Easy to use straight from the drum;
Doesn't need refrigerating;
Contains no live microbes;
Activates beneficial lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria;
Inhibits spoilage moulds and yeasts;
Reduces losses in dry matter and quality; and
Cows prefer it.
Mr Smyth has a good understanding of how the products work.
"HayKing, works by reducing the growth of the yeasts and fungi that use up feed energy, heat bales and produce mycotoxins," he said.
"SilageKing activates the beneficial ensiling bacteria in grass and cereal forage while reducing spoilage yeasts and fungi.
"Unlike other products, Biostart products have no live bacteria.
"so that means the product remains stable and can be stored easily, and they don't corrode machinery or sting your skin."
