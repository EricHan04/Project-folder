WHILE the story for many businesses in 2020 was pivoting to online, a young Torquay business went another way.
Summer Skin Australia co-founder Georgia Minear said the original hope for the two-year-old business’ range of natural face and body skincare products was to be exclusive to their own website.
But a combination of the pandemic and the challenge of cracking into the giant health and beauty market forced Ms Minear and her Adelaide-based business partner Lil McAvaney to reconsider.
Ms Minear said sales were quiet in the early months of the pandemic. “We are a small business and we didn’t have the money to pump into online marketing,” she said.
“We thought: ‘We have to explore some other options here, because … we need to be seen.’ ” They enlisted retailers in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia to take on the brand, and wholesaling created a new revenue stream in the second half of the year.
The company obtained further exposure for its Australian-made products when it was taken up by The Iconic, and then new platform Buy Aussie Now also reached out in the middle of last year.
Officially launched by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Friday, Buy Now is an online marketplace for Australian products.
Ms Minear welcomed the exposure and said people’s appreciation for Australian-made was one of the few good things to come out of the pandemic. “Consumers are a lot more conscious these days about where their products are coming from,” she said.
