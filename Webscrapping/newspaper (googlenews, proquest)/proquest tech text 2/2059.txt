BRITISH space company Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) has set up an office at Lot Fourteen – its first in the southern hemisphere.
SSTL has been developing and building small satellites for more than 40 years, and has supported more than 20 countries in developing their space capabilities.
The company, a subsidiary of French multinational Airbus, will service the country from its Adelaide base.
Earlier this year SSTL was selected as a partner in the Department of Defence’s Resilient Multi-mission Space (RMS) STaR Shot program – a strategic research scheme established to develop future space capabilities for the Australian Defence Force.
SSTL managing director Phil Brownnett said the company would look to collaborate with the Australian space industry by sharing its knowledge, intellectual property and experience.
“We will bring our world-renowned technology to Australia, to support local companies to take a step-up in sovereign capability.” SSTL will be located close to the Australian Space Agency and also the Defence Science and Technology Group in Edinburgh.
Defence and Space Industries Minister Susan Close said the arrival of SSTL would complement other space companies that had chosen to set up in Adelaide. “World-leading capabilities within the space industry, alongside global space companies, are creating incredible growth within the space sector and showcasing our state’s strengths within the industry.”
