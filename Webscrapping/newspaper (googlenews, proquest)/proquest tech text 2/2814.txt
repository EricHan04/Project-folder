MOTORING AUSTRALIAN motorcycle company Braaap is soon to launch a capital raise through new equity crowd-funding platform Swarmer, with the money to be used to expand in the US and launch its new range of electric motorbikes.
The company is also developing a subscription-based ownership model, with its research showing that 62 per cent of Australian motorcycle licence holders don’t actually own a bike.
Founder and chief executive Brad Smith said the subscription program, RideClub, would remove the economic barrier to entry for current and future riders alike, and allow them to ride a portfolio of different machines.
“Building a subscription model means riders don’t need debt or cash to ride, it means they don’t need to be stuck on the one bike they can afford but can choose from a fleet of 3000 new and maintained bikes,’’ Mr Smith said. “Our vision for the future of motorcycling is that you won’t need to own a bike, but be a member of our ‘RideClub’ to have access to a fleet of awesome bikes.” On the electric front, Braaap pre-sold its first two production runs, and will soon be delivering the first bikes to customers.
Mr Smith said that Braaap was able to deliver an e-motorcycle for the same price as the petrol-powered equivalent.
“Braaap is bringing to the market a cost-effective and electric, environmentally-friendly motorcycle option. This is the game changer.” Mr Smith founded Braaap in Launceston in 2005, with its bike range manufactured in China with final assembly and quality assurance in Australia. To date, the now Victoria-based company has put more than 10,000 vehicles on the road. It is seeking expressions of interest for its crowd-funding raise through Swarmer, with the final amount to be raised yet to be determined.
