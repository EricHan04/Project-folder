SOME forests are experiencing big declines in resilience – the ability to withstand and recover from environmental disturbances – in response to climate change, according to international scientists. Forests’ important role in the global carbon cycle, potential mitigation of future climate change, protecting soil from erosion, and supporting biodiversity requires a level of resilience. The team assessed changes in resilience between 2000 and 2020, using a combination of satellite images and artificial intelligence, and found that the resilience of tropical, arid and temperate forests had declined over this period.
