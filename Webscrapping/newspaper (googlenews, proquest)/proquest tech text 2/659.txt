AUSTRALIA Post is offering a new personalised postcard and greeting card service through German start-up company MyPostcard.
Anyone can turn photos into postcards sent straight from their smartphone, tablet or computer, to letterboxes anywhere in the world.
MyPostcard manages the printing, postage and mailing worldwide. Australia Post delivers all orders sent to Australian addresses.
Sabrina Frangos, 38, of Magill has discovered that sending postcards is a great way to stay in touch with her parents in Germany. “They really miss seeing their granddaughter grow up so it’s nice to capture these precious moments in a postcard, and for mum and dad to find a little surprise in their letterbox each month,” she said. “We love going to the local parks and taking photos, so we’ve decided to start making more of these postcards to send to our family in Australia too.”
