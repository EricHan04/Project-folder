HALTING construction work during the lockdown is a “drastic measure” that will affect more than 50,000 staff and risk delaying mayor projects, industry leaders say.
The state government has omitted the construction sector from a list of essential workers, forcing staff to down tools for at least seven days.
Builders were yesterday racing to secure commercial and residential construction sites ahead of the 6pm curfew.
Master Builders SA chief executive Will Frogley, pictured, said 72,600 people were employed in the state’s construction industry, with the equivalent of 52,300 of them working “on site”.
“When construction stops, South Australia’s economy stops, so to shut down every building site from Mt Gambier to Ceduna is a drastic measure,” he said.
“Builders are under the pump to get jobs such as school building projects completed within tight deadlines.
“Given this lockdown is government enforced, consequences must be taken into account and be properly compensated.” Mr Frogley said the sector had a strong record of managing safety. “We know how to manage risk, socially distance on site and ensure hygiene standards.” The MBSA has asked the government to give builders until close of business today to shut down building sites and make them secure to avoid damage and theft.
Housing Industry Association SA managing director Stephen Knight was surprised by the decision to lock down the construction sector.
“It’s a bit cruel to stop,” he said. “The issue with building is if you stop it for a week it doesn’t just start up again the next day. You have got to reschedule workers, materials – it will take two to three weeks to recover.”
