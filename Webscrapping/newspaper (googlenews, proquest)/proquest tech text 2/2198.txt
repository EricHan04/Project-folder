NEW electric hot water systems and air conditioners will need to be fitted with smart technology to link the time they are switched on to when power prices are cheaper, under a State Government plan.
The government is beginning a consultation process on how smart controllers could be fitted to all energy-hungry devices, which would also include pool pumps and electric vehicle chargers. “Retrofitting these appliances can be expensive and labour intensive, but new technology means that it’s cheaper and easier for South Australians if they come as a standard feature,” Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said.
“At times, we have an overabundance of renewable energy and at other times we rely on more expensive fossil fuels to supply what we aren’t getting from the wind and sun.
“As old appliances are replaced over time, all SA homes can voluntarily become ‘smart energy homes’.” The Government intends to make fitting the technology mandatory but it would be up to consumers whether they use it or not.
