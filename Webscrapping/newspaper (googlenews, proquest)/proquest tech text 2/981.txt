A SOUTH Australian company has grown to 80 staff, four offices and 70 clients in just over two years, making it one of the fastest growing start-ups in the country.
Escient co-founder Stephen Mabbs, who set up the company in November 2016 with Tom Stianos and Tin Tran, said attracting highly skilled employees and clients and offering both value propositions was key to the rapid growth.
Escient is a management consulting firm helping various federal and state government departments, local councils and private companies with strategic advice and implementation.
It was ranked third on LinkedIn’s list of top 25 start-ups in Australia in terms of attracting talent in 2018 — behind NSW graphic design company Canva and freelance digital marketplace Expert360.
“Right from the start, we have been focused on making it attractive for both clients and employees to stay with us for the long term,” Mr Mabbs said. “For the kind of talent we are attracting – some of them are scientists, accountants, lawyers and most of them are quite entrepreneurial – we needed to make it attractive to stay.” Mr Mabbs said a staff shares and options scheme, which was equitable for all levels of employees, had proved attractive.
Offering work flexibility and diversity had also attracted new staff, with the business now sitting at 50 per cent gender equity, he said.
“I would say about half the number of staff now have a security interest in the business,” Mr Mabbs said.
Escient has also set up a client advisory board in its effort to be open about its capabilities and open up a platform for feedback.
“We are active in the big three areas of government – health, education and transport and infrastructure – so it’s a critical to have transparency and collaboration,” he said.The company opened a new Brisbane office in mid-January, while the Adelaide office is also looking to boost workforce levels.
