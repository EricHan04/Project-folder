ISRAEL Folau will likely be in the stands when Australia play New Zealand in their Netball World Cup clash tonight after the sacked rugby star was spotted in Liverpool.
Folau has quietly travelled to the England to support his wife, Silver Ferns shooter Maria.
The 30-year-old, who is in a legal battle with Rugby Australia following his contract termination over a social media post that claimed “hell awaits” gay people, has kept a low ­profile in Liverpool, staying off social media.
However, there’s every chance he will be courtside when Maria and New Zealand line up against the Diamonds.
Even before Folau arrived, the saga surrounding his ­religious views had bled into netball’s biggest ­tournament.
Maria has come under fire for endorsing Israel’s crowd-funding efforts to help pay for his legal fees and has declined to speak to the press all ­tournament.
Netball Australia, Super Netball and the Adelaide Thunderbirds determined Folau’s Instagram post had not breached their social media policies and she would therefore not be sanctioned.
Australian netball legend Liz Ellis slammed the decision as “not good enough”, while Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander and others believe it’s more complicated.The Silver Ferns have made it clear their priority is Maria’s wellbeing.
