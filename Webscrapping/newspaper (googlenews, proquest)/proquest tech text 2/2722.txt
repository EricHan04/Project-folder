AN Adelaide business that has put people at the heart of its digital data analytics business, employing all its 80 staff on a permanent basis, is looking to grow its “tribe”.
Innodev chief executive Tim Browne – who started the business 12 years ago after a decade with Motorola – hopes to grow to 120 staff in the next 12-18 months.
The business offers state government departments in SA, Victoria and Queensland and defence companies, universities and utilities help with technology architecture, change management, digital risk management and data analytics.
“Our solutions are digital but we are delivering to people,” Mr Browne said. “That has proved to be the difference in how fast we have grown in the three states we operate in.” “Creating a sense of belonging and belief in our tribe is what has contributed to bringing in and retaining long-term clients to the business.
“That is one of the reasons we employ everyone permanent.” In the past one year, the business has grown 40 per cent, Mr Browne said, on the back of a staff workshop that helped create a “culture book”. It features 64 stories from staff about their proudest experience of working at the company.
“These stories were condensed ... and what we refer to as our culture book was created. It underlines the foundation of what we believe in, our relationship with clients and has provided us with a shared vision.” Innodev recently hired Rob Absalom, an information and communications technology (ICT) industry veteran as its chief operating officer.
Mr Absalom has worked with SMS Management & Technology, BHP and Bravura Solutions.With 10 to 15 key clients and a strong base in South Australia, the group is focused on winning more clients in Melbourne, Victoria.
