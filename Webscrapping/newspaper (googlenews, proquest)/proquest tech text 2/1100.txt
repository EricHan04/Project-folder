FIRST it was autonomous ­vehicles, then it was Snowy Hydro robot dogs, now it is time for a new piece of futuristic tech to hit our shores.
Acting Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles has officially launched a new supercomputer program that is up to a million times faster than a standard ­computer.
The state-of-the-art technology, the first of its kind in Australia, will enable defence scientists to analyse large data sets and rapidly perform complex calculations to tackle some of the trickiest scientific and engineering problems.
Expected to play a role in the design, development and analysis of modern weapons systems and national security systems, the new gadget is set to boost our ability to develop key AUKUS priorities, including nuclear-powered submarines, quantum technologies and artificial intelligence.
Mr Marles said the handy new tool would be crucial for our experts. “For much of the work done by our defence scientists, data is critical,” he said.
“But even more important than the data itself is the ability to rapidly and reliably analyse and process that data.
“This high-performance computing facility provides a secure and sovereign capability to do just that.” The advanced new powers will be used at the Defence Science and Technology Group site at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct in South Australia. In a statement released by the federal government on Tuesday, Mr Marles explained the new computing infrastructure was known as “Taingi­wilta”, meaning “powerful” in the language of the Kaurna people – the First Nations people of Adelaide.
