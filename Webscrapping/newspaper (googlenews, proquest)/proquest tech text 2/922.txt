A POOL of $450,000 has been set aside by the State Government to encourage angel investors to put their hands in their pockets.
The Government has launched the Activate Angels program, which will match funding on a one for one basis over up to three years for angel investor groups.
The money will come from the Research, Commercialisation and Start-up Fund and is a key plank of the government’s FIXE Strategy which aims to invigorate the start up sector.
“Applications are now open and participants will commit to developing and nurturing a community of angel investors, developing knowledge and skills in early stage investing, developing relationships with interstate and international investors and curating a pipeline of investible companies,’’ the government said.
Minister for Innovation and Skills David Pisoni said it would help with the capital needs of early stage businesses.
“South Australia needs a robust ‘angel investor’ network if companies are to progress to a point where they can access other sources of funding to fuel their growth, such as venture capital,” he said.
“Active and well-co-ordinated angel groups play a critical role in start-up ecosystems, providing more than just investment from members. They also provide valuable strategic and operational expertise and access to trusted networks and target markets.’’Details are on the Department for Innovation and Skills website.
