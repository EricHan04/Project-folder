AUSTRALIAN property management start-up :Different has raised $25m via a Series B funding round, led by Commonwealth Bank’s venture capital arm x15ventures and Antler.
The deal will see CBA and :Different team up on offers and benefits for homeowners.
Founded by ex-Silicon Valley executives Mina Radhakrishnan and Ruwin Perera, :Different has doubled its team in the last year and its property management platform will soon be available across CBA channels including the CommBank app to guide users throughout their home buying journey.
“We started :Different because we had heard all too many horror stories of property owners and renters having a subpar experience with their property managers,” Ms Radhakrishnan said. “Little communication and transparency into the important things that can make a real difference to the overall living and ownership experience. “We knew ... with people who care and powerful technology, we could create a better experience for our property owners, their properties and the people who live in them.”
