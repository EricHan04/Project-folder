AN Adelaide start-up supporting local hospitality venues has been acquired by one of the country’s biggest business-to-business (B2B) media groups.
Food & Beverage Media, a subsidiary of The Intermedia Group, snapped up Bellr for an undisclosed price and will deploy the company’s technology across its suite of hospitality trade publications.
The Sydney-based company publishes titles including Australian Hotelier, The Shout and Hospitality Magazine.
Bellr was established last year by high school friends Mitchell Stapleton-Coory and Matthew Giorgio as a platform to support hospitality venues attract and retain customers through promotions and loyalty programs.
Mr Stapleton-Coory said while the Bellr network would be deactivated as part of the transition, the technology would evolve under new ownership.
“At the peak we were working with close to 60 venues but it’s always been about the technology,” he said.
“The technology is going to be absorbed into by Intermedia Group and they’ll look to rebrand and redeploy it under each of their titles.
“They were an early investor in Bellr so they’ve been with us through the journey.” The first project to be developed with Bellr’s technology will be a craft beer app to sit alongside Food & Beverage Media Group’s Beer & Brewer publication.
Mr Stapleton-Coory and Mr Matthew Giorgio will remain as consultants during a transition stage but have separate plans to launch a new venture in Adelaide this summer.“We’re planning on using the sale of the app to kickstart something brand new which we’re looking to launch in Adelaide early next year,” he said.
