MEL OTTAWAY EXECUTIVE MANAGER SERVICES FOR OLDER PEOPLE UNITING COMMUNITIES
THE world of technology is rapidly surrounding all of us, whether we like it or not.
While there are some frightening stories about the impact of cyber crime and scams, technology presents some amazing opportunities.
The digital world should not replace valuable face-to-face relationships but during Covid it provides new ways to stay connected.
Our travelling may have been restricted but we have been able to stay in touch using applications such as Zoom, FaceTime and Teams.
Such words were foreign to many of us a few years ago.
The online world can also offer learning opportunities, such as researching new information, playing online puzzles and games or discovering new interests.
The world of googling provides endless pathways which can keep us enthralled, let alone the opportunity for online shopping.
Advances in digital health allow for improved health monitoring within your home, including monitoring vital signs such as blood pressure, or health consultations with specialists that enable access to remote regions. There is also technology that supports safety in the home, including the ability to send an alert if someone has had a fall.
It is important, however, to ensure we maintain the appropriate levels of security to limit the risk of cyber attacks. This includes regularly changing your passwords and avoiding clicking on unsolicited or suspicious links.
You might like to visit your local library for technology guidance to help you navigate the world of computers and stay safe online. The theme for International Day of Older Persons on October 1 this year was digital equity for all ages. Letâ€™s embrace the digital world and see where it can take us.
