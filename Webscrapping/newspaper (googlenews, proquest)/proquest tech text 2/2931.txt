MOTORISTS could soon save hundreds of dollars a year in fuel costs with a new app developed in Adelaide.
Local entrepreneurs Daniel Devine and Luigi Antonuccio are gearing up for the launch of their app, Refueler, which allows users to pre-buy fuel and avoid costly price hikes. Users will be able to pre-buy up to $250 of fuel at the advertised price at a specific petrol station, and will then be given 10 days to redeem the purchase.
After more than two years of research and development, the app went live in a single petrol station in Melbourne yesterday, ahead of a national rollout expected before Christmas.
Mr Devine said the launch came at the perfect time, because of recent price fluctuations that saw fuel prices hit 10-year highs earlier this month, and prompted renewed calls for real-time fuel pricing in South Australia.
“The RAA’s biggest recommendation is to fill up while it’s cheap but sometimes you can’t because your tank’s full, you might be at work or you just can’t get to a servo,” he said.
“If you see that fuel prices are rising, you can just download the app, pre-purchase fuel at the cheaper price at whatever servo on our platform and then … pick up the fuel later.” An Australian Consumer and Competition report, released this month, found motorists who filled up at SA’s cheapest fuel retailers saved up to $159 last year.
The Refueler co-founders believe their app, which is free to download and use, will deliver even bigger savings.
Mr Antonuccio said 500 petrol stations across the country, including around 20 in South Australia, had registered interest in joining the app ahead of a major fundraising campaign kicking off today.Refueler is hoping to raise at least $500,000 through equity crowd-funding website Birchal.
