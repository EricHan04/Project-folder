CRYPTOCURRENCY is in a “make-or-break” moment after bitcoin’s wild ride took a dramatic turn on Wednesday, but experts are split on which way the currency will go, with some declaring the bubble burst and others convinced it is a steal at $US30,000.
“The investment case (for bitcoin) is a hard one; this is a liquidity-filled market,” said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone.
“If the pace and the rate of change of growth in the Fed’s balance sheet is going to decline – and we expect a formal announcement at the September meeting, and the Jackson Hole symposium to be the strong signal to the market – then I think a lot of these liquidity beneficiaries, such as the meme stocks, bitcoin and crypto, will find headwinds.” China’s latest crackdown triggered the sell-off in cryptocurrencies this week. The People’s Bank of China on Mon­day told major banks and payments giant Alipay to stop facilitating crypto transactions.
It came after China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining at the weekend in a move that saw it shut down 90 per cent of its mining capacity.
Investors quickly dumped cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin forming a “death cross” on Tuesday overnight, meaning its 50-day moving average dropped below the 200-day moving average. It later stabilised to trade above $US32,000 but the latest whack means it has plunged 50 per cent plunge from its April high above $US64,000. However, it was trading at $US9600 a year ago.
