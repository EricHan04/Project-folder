The 2021 Sustain series is one of the strongest in Shimano’s Magnum Lite range. Re-engineered from top to bottom, the new Sustain series features a range of upgrades such as MicroModule II and MGL Rotor to improve its finesse and on-water performance.
This model incorporates an MGL rotor to create light a start-up, which allows the angler to wind faster and set the hooks quicker. Combining the MGL Rotor with the Hagane body produces a light, yet strong reel that can handle big salt water battles. It is lighter than its predecessor and now features a Long Stroke Spool to provide improved casting distance.
MicroModule II gearing is matched with Shimano’s cold forged Hagane Gear and Silent Drive technologies for smoother reeling performance.
The matte black finish with gold trim and 8+1 ball bearings are sure to impress all anglers – and the new feature upgrades will keep turning the heads of hard-fighting fish. SA Angler is the state’s premier fishing publication. Log on to saangler.com.au
