GUT disorders may not be all in the mind but researchers are checking if the mind can help manage them.
A new trial using hypnotherapy aims to provide more effective and efficient care to patients with inflammatory gut disorders.
Head of the RAH Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Service, gastroenterologist Professor Jane Andrews, said the trial could lead to better treatment options.
“How your brain feels affects your gut and vice versa, so we want to see whether psychological intervention has any influence on illnesses like Crohn’s disease,” Prof Andrews said.
She said patients would be provided with their normal treatment, as well as hypnotherapy.
They would then be assessed to see if they felt better, as well as their levels of stress hormones.
“If effective, treatments like hypnotherapy could one day become a normal option for patients experiencing these types of issues,” Prof Andrews said, The research is being highlighted as part of the Royal Adelaide Hospital’s “RAHsearch showcase”, where 14 of the hospital’s brightest medical minds are sharing their latest findings.
The online event, which winds up today, is showcasing a variety of RAH research projects.
Colorectal surgeon Associate Professor Tarik Sammour discussed his work using artificial intelligence to predict the severity of bowel cancer.
He said the concept was similar to the way Facebook was able to identify a person’s face in a photo.
“We are training the algorithm to understand what a cancer is, what a bad cancer is and what a good cancer is in terms of survival,” Prof Sammour said.
“We show the computer hundreds of images of different bowel cancers, which it can draw on to identify a new cancer and predict its severity.
“This will help us identify the most-appropriate treatment option to achieve the best outcome.” See rah.sa.gov.au/research/research-events/rahsearch-2020
