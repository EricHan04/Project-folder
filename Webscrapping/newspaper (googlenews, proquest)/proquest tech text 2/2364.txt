AUSTRALIA’S primary stock exchange says a key technology upgrade initially scheduled to go live a year ago will now be delayed until the second half of 2023.
A month after telling investors the shift to a blockchain-based replacement for its CHESS system was on track for an April 2023 launch, the ASX on Monday indicated it now faced more months of ­delays. The ASX uses CHESS to keep track of investors’ holdings and personal details. It is the fourth delay for the $250m project – designed to usurp a system that has been used for more than 25 years. It was initially meant to be ready by April last year.
