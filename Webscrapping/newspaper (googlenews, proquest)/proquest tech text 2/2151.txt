AGL has signed agreements with Finland's Wartsila and US storage provider Fluence for the supply up to 1000 megawatts of grid-scale battery storage.
AGL has announced plans to build batteries in Victoria, South Australia and at the Hunter's Liddell power station near Muswellbrook.
Chief operating officer, Markus Brokhof said Wartsila and Fluence were chosen through a competitive tender process for their capability, experience and pricing.
"This framework agreement is another example of AGL getting on with the business of energy transition and will enable delivery against our commitment to build 850MW of grid-scale battery storage by FY2024," Mr Brokhof said.
"We're excited to see our grid-scale battery plans begin to come to life; we know energy storage technology is critical in creating cleaner and smarter distributed energy infrastructure.
"Our grid-scale battery plans provide critical firming capacity to the market and will play a leading role in the energy industry's transition over the coming decades."
The first phase at Liddell involves a 150-megwatt battery, but AGL is seeking approval for up to 500 megawatts. Wartsila Energy's Suraj Narayan said he was delighted by AGL's decision.
"AGL is a valued customer for Wartsila and we look forward to providing our smart technology solutions to support AGL's plans for critical firming capacity that will play a leading role in the energy transition from coal to renewables," Mr Narayan said.
