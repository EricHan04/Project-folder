THERE are “massive opportunities” for a wide range of highly skilled jobs linked to health technology, Flinders University’s Professor of Digital Health Systems, Trish Williams, believes.
It can also help unclog hospital emergency departments as wearable and home-based monitoring systems alert people to potential problems before they escalate.
“EDs are clogged with people who have chronic conditions, and we have the ability now to do a lot of monitoring that can help prevent some of those admissions,” she told the forum.
The forum also discussed “clunky” technology, with strong views that patients and clinicians needed to be involved from the start.
“There are still a level of major IT projects that fail; 50 per cent of them don’t go very well,” Prof Williams said.
“The majority of the problems start at that very early stage when you don’t have the right people in the room at the beginning – you cannot do that in healthcare.” Prof Williams said there was an overarching framework around privacy protections of health data, but there was general agreement that, in an emergency, quick access to records can save lives.
“When I go into emergency, I don’t care who looks at my data, I want anybody who can fix me to look at it,” she said.
