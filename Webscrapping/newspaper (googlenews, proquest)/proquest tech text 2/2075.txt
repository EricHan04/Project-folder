Peter Teunissen Curtin University Field leader in Geophysics
Curtin University senior professor Peter Teunissen has seen the field of satellite technology expand at a phenomenal rate over the past few decades.
From a distance of thousands of kilometres, satellites can now help detect ore deposits on Earth, determine the moisture content of soil for better crop planting, provide instant navigation assistance for walkers and motorists, accurately predict weather patterns and ensure that no one with a satellite-connected device will ever be truly lost again.
Today, dependence on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) has penetrated all levels of society, Teunissen says.
“The timing systems we are using for computers, the synchronisation of timing – that’s all linked to GNSS.” Awarded an Australian Research Council Federation Fellowship, the precursor of the current ARC Laureate Fellowship, Teunissen moved to Australia more than a decade ago.
He has been associated with Curtin University since 2009 and he is now an award-winning expert in the field of satellite technology, specialising in interferometric GNSS, the use of satellite signals for the high precision measurement of the parameters of water and land masses.
The new frontier of miniaturised satellites has also caught Teunissen’s attention. Called cubesats – and often not much larger than a loaf of bread – the mini-satellites are within the economic reach of universities and corporations. “The cubesats really are the future for increasing the number of satellites and constellations because even students, of course with proper supervision, are able to design satellites and then they can be launched with a much lower budget,” he says.
Teunissen has been fascinated by the potential of satellite technology from the field’s earliest days. As a professor of geodesy, classically the study of the Earth’s shape and surface, in the early 1990s he was invited to choose his own specialisation at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
He looked to the emerging field of satellite technology and discovered that his homeland had no GPS know-how, no GPS infrastructure and no GPS equipment. He used generous grant funding from the Netherlands’ Royal Academy of Sciences to buy the nation’s first GPS receiver for $US300,000.
As a demonstration of the rocketing speed of the field’s development, he says that nowadays such a GPS receiver might cost $US100.
