THE Irwin family has released touching details about their project launch into the crypto world, with their first non-fungible token collection paying tribute to Steve Irwin.
In partnership with the Australian-based technology start-up Meadow Labs, the rare NFT project will consist of a series of digital artworks that can be bought by the public, with each piece of art focusing on a different Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors animal.
The project will raise awareness and funds to protect Australia’s wildlife and wild places, a cause close to the heart of the Irwin family.
An NFT is a unique digital asset stored on a digital ledger (blockchain) that can be sold or traded.
Each token, which can take different forms including a digital image or video, is uniquely identifiable. However, unlike Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, NFTs cannot be replicated. The project will launch on June 14. The first Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors NFT drop will focus on the Australian “Warrior Croc” saltwater crocodile.
