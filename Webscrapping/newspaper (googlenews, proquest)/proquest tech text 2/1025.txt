ROCKET launches in South Australia will get a boost from a Federal Government project to be announced today.
The Pathway to Launch project will look at everything needed to make sure launches comply with legislation, regulation, risk frameworks and how to protect the nation’s interests, environment and safety.
Almost $1 million from the already announced Space Infrastructure Fund will be used. Another $2.5 million will fund new facilities so that companies can test their space equipment without going overseas.
While the funding will be spread nationally, SA start-up companies are in a prime position to take full advantage of the support.
Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews said there was “no limit” to SA’s involvement in the space sector. “This builds on the strong record of delivery for SA in the space field, already the home of the Space Agency,” Ms Andrews said.
“SA companies currently have the ability to build many aspects of a spacecraft. “We’ve seen local businesses like Fleet, Myriota and Inovor dive into the space sector we’re growing in SA, and we want more businesses to do that.” Meanwhile, Southern Launch is planning to build a mobile launch facility on the Eyre Peninsula. South Australians would be able to watch launches from the Whalers Way spot.
Ms Andrews said the new projects would build on the funding for the Mission Control Centre, the Space Discovery Centre and the SmartSat Co-operative Research Centre, all of which combine to make Adelaide the national home of space.
At a SA Space Industry Centre forum this week, some industry figures raised concerns that despite the announcements Labor would lure elements of the industry towards Canberra with the development of a $20 million hub nearby.Labor said it was dedicated to keeping the Space Agency in Adelaide.
