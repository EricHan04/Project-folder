MADELEINE is all smiles holding her virtual reality headset at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital.
Five minutes earlier, though, her mum Natalie was wiping away tears as Madeleine prepared for her 16th blood test as part of a national study into type 1 diabetes.
The six-year-old, of West Beach, is testing out the VR technology in a bid to distract her from the painful procedure.
While phlebotomist Ben Ramoso is extracting blood, Madeleine is swimming with dol-phins, whales and turtles. “I think it’s awesome,” Natalie said. Mr Ramoso said: “It’s a great tool because the children really like it and don’t feel what is happening around them.
“It’s a great distraction. It will take Madeleine’s mind off the procedure, especially in the hospital, which is such a sterile and foreign environment to her.” Madeleine is perfectly healthy but she’s putting her body on the line to help Australian children – such as her older sister Olivia – who suffer from type 1 diabetes.
The auto-immune disease is twice more common in Australian children today than 20 years ago. The Friends of the WCH have provided four VR headsets to the Environmental Determinants of Islet Autoimmunity study into the causes of type 1 diabetes in children.ENDIA researcher Kelly McGorm said the study being conducted at the WCH required regular blood tests to be taken from 1400 participants nationwide, from newborn to six years. She said part of the study would involve evaluating the effectiveness of VR technology in reducing anxiety and pain management during blood withdrawals with children.
