SALEYARDS across the state were thrown into "mayhem" on Wednesday last week, after the SA government announced the state-wide COVID-19 lockdown.
But despite the livestock sector's uncertainty about its immediate future, markets had to go ahead as planned.
With major sheep and lamb markets scheduled for the Thursday at Jamestown and Naracoorte, Nutrien Ag Solutions agent Shannon Jaeschke said it was too late "to pull the pin".
"We already had more than 4000 penned because sheep arrived on Monday - it would have come at a significant cost to everyone if the market was postponed," he said.
"It was a strange scenario and even though we always have a COVID-19 safe plan in place, in the immediate, it was hard to see how the market was going to go ahead."
Limited numbers of agents and processors attended the market, but despite the lack of buyers present, prices were not affected.
"AuctionsPlus underpinned the sale completely," Mr Jaeschke said.
Pinkerton Palm Hamlyn & Steen agent Richard Harvie agreed the sudden restrictions caused some chaos.
"It was mayhem for livestock trading and abattoirs - no one had any idea what was happening," he said.
"The government needs to have protocols in place and ready to go for primary industries - they have had nine months and for an entire industry to be in the dark, causes big repercussions.
"It was late Wednesday night and abattoirs did not officially know if they were allowed to kill the next day - you cannot just start up and shut down those places in a flash."
Elders Dublin livestock manager Matt Ward said agents were scrambling late last week to get a market at Dublin organised.
"We just did not think it would happen after such drastic restrictions," he said.
"Though we had reduced numbers at Dublin because vendors held off organising carriers because of uncertainty - there was too much risk of a financial loss."
