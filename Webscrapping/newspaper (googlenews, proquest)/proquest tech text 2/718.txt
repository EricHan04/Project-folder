A MAJOR focus on cryptocurrencies, plus visa and research and development changes and more funding for climate start-ups dominate the wishlist of Australian start-ups, with the sector hoping extra support from the federal government can help propel a sector that’s already generating record numbers of billion-dollar businesses.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is expected to announce tonight a shake-up to employee share regulations, making it easier for local start-ups to compete for talent.
The proposed changes involve lifting the $5000 cap that limited the shares or options handed out to employees of unlisted companies including high-growth start-ups, a rule which executives say has forced talent overseas.
Adam Milgrom, partner of impact investment venture capital firm Giant Leap, welcomed those changes but wants more targeted support for female founders and start-ups helping health and climate. He said the federal government’s role was to help support the start-up ecosystem – without backing winners.
“We’d love to see increases in early-stage R&D funding for clean-tech and health-tech companies as we have amazing founders creating solutions to the climate crisis, and combining research and technology to solve complex healthcare challenges. Both areas have been largely underfunded to date,” Mr Milgrom said.
Crypto will also likely be a focus of the budget, after Treasury last week made a commitment to consult industry over the development of new regulation of digital assets. Jonathon Miller, the Australian managing director of crypto exchange Kraken, said further budget measures should help cement Australia‘s new-found status as a market leader in fintech competition and crypto technology.
