WHEN Emil Davityan rushed back to Adelaide from San Francisco after COVID hit, he thought the move would be temporary.
But impressed by what he found, the co-founder and chief executive of location technology company Bluedot expects to spend a lot more time in his home town. “It’s been great to see how SA has changed, both the city and the start-up ecosystem,” he said.
Mr Davityan started Bluedot – a location data platform that connects businesses and consumers – in 2013 with Filip Eldic. Soon after, they relocated the company to Melbourne, and, in 2015, expanded it to San Francisco, where Mr Davityan had been living for the past four years.
After returning to SA, he opened an office at Lot Fourteen. “It’s vibrant, it’s creative and it’s designed to bring world-class experts and experience back to Adelaide,” he said. “We plan on spending a lot more time … back in Adelaide.” His colleague, Ben Colley, feels the same. Mr Colley returned to Adelaide with his wife, Sarah, 13 weeks ago, after eight years living in Melbourne.
Three weeks later, Mrs Colley gave birth to their first child, Hadley. “We’re both originally from Adelaide,” Mr Colley said. “When she found out she was pregnant, she said there was no negotiation, we were going home.” Mr Colley initially had some reservations about the move.
“But I could not tell you how much fun I’m having and how incredibly surprised I am at the momentum in SA,” he said.
