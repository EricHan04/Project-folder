Crime Stoppers SA has called for community support to help fight country crime.
The organisation launched a Go Fund Me page to help fund the campaign for the first time after it was denied funding by the state government.
A target of $150,000 has been set, with 100 per cent of all money received to be directly spent on development and delivery of the campaign across country SA locations.
Crime Stoppers South Australia chair Sharon Hanlon said this was the first time the crime-solving organisation had turned to a crowd funding solution.
The Australian Institute of Criminology says crime in rural areas is increasing.
"Livestock theft across SA left farmers $1.2 million out of pocket in 2016/17," Ms Hanlon said.
"In addition, farms have experienced theft of farm machinery, equipment, vehicles, material, tools and spare parts - all of which are needed to stay operational."
