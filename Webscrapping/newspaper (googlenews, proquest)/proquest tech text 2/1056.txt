With an increase in resources and artificial intelligence, the Dudley Peninsula feral cat trapping program has continued to achieve remarkable results since 2020.
An increased staffing base and community support, it has allowed the team to trap huge sections of the road network of the Dudley Peninsula simultaneously.
With more staff and help from the Dudley community, the Dudley Peninsula feral cat eradication team led by the Kangaroo Island Landscape Board have now removed over 500 feral cats across the Dudley Peninsula including many at the fence gaps.
Advances in artificial intelligence has significantly helped the team, with the 4G camera network across the Dudley Peninsula continuously growing and the eVorta artificial intelligence platform has also improved in accuracy at correctly classifying species.
The system can now definitively detect feral cats in complex images that humans would likely miss.
Once fully deployed, the 4G array will provide 24/7 monitoring - not only of feral cats, but of a whole range of important native KI species.
The system works at high speed and can process and label images at a maximum speed of 100 per second.
The amount of useful information coming in from the field in real time, has outshone traditional methods, such as driving to each camera and downloading SD cards.
This has significantly freed up resources and the next step for the eradication team is to couple the instant notifications about feral cat presence from the 4G cameras with methods to eradicate them quickly.
The team are now working towards having detector canines on-hand when eVorta alerts the team of a feral cat presence.
The team would travel to the site and use the detector canine to find the cat and bail it.
In the coming months, this system is expected to be refined.
