IT was third time unlucky for South Australian space start- up Southern Launch after their rocket caught fire.
Two previous attempts to launch the TiSPACE rocket from the Whaler’s Way range on Friday and Wednesday were thwarted by high winds and technical issues.
In a statement, the company said a fire broke out during the launch operation at 4.09pm on Thursday.
“During ignition, the launch vehicle suffered an internal fault causing the vehicle to catch alight,” the statement said.
“The fire was contained to the launch pad and was attended to by the South Australian Country Fire Service, who were onsite. No people or the environment were put at risk.” The rocket range, on coastal land about 32km south of Port Lincoln, has caused controversy in the Eyre Peninsula city with many residents concerned about the potential impact on the area’s fauna and flora and popular beaches.
