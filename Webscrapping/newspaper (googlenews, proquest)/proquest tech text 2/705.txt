COMMONWEALTH Bank has taken a 20 per cent equity stake in a start-up gift card business called Karta, which is promising to shake up and disrupt a segment of the retail sector that is worth more than $29bn a year.
Karta is preparing to launch next year and is busy signing up retailers and other businesses to its digital gift card platform.
“Shopping is an area where consumers expect more sophisticated offerings and experiences,” CBA executive general manager for everyday banking Kate Crous said.
“Simplifying the purchase, delivery and use of gift cards and enabling more businesses to participate in this market will enable CBA customers to better support businesses they love.” CBA has declined to disclose the amount it invested in Sydney-based Karta to take its 20 per cent stake.
Founded last year, Karta is owned by its founders and staff, and will be launching its maiden offering next year.
Karta chief executive David Anderson said the gift card industry hasn’t changed much since US video store Blockbuster launched one of the first gift cards in the 1990s and was ripe for disruption.
Mr Anderson said gift cards are a core part of the shopping experience and it is estimated that the prepaid card market in Australia will grow to $40bn a year in the next five years.
“Consumers and businesses are often left frustrated by restrictive expiry dates, burdensome costs to administer gift cards, wastage on cards, as well as the costly investment to integrate gifting into merchant systems,” he said. “Technology has changed but gifting has not.” Mr Anderson said Karta’s technology platform was scalable globally and bolstered by a multi-year strategic partnership with MasterCard. He said this means that Karta gift cards can be used at any participating business that accepts MasterCard.
