A COLUMNIST’S claim an SA businesswoman invested in “peanut start-ups” ignored her “remarkable” reputation, the Federal Court has heard.
Elaine Stead, the director of the now-defunct fund manager Blue Sky, is suing the Australian Financial Review’s Joe Aston for defamation over a series of columns that Dr Stead claims made her look “reckless” and “stupid”.
In opening submissions in the Federal Court yesterday, Sue Chrysanthou SC argued Dr Stead was a “highly educated”, well-respected venture capital investor.
Aston’s columns were “highly offensive and damaging”, Ms Chrysanthou said. She said there was no expert evidence tendered in Mr Aston’s defence to date to make the case that Dr Stead’s track record was poor. Instead, there was a “feeble attempt” to list a number of companies that did not perform well.
Ms Chrysanthou said investors such as Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes had invested in Shoes of Prey — a company Aston characterised as a “peanut start-up”.
Ms Chrysanthou told the court that there had been “no such personal attacks” on the men who were previously on the Blue Sky board. “We say that Mr Aston targeted my client because she is a woman,” Ms Chrysanthou said.
Nine Entertainment Co, the owner of the Australian Financial Review, filed a defence in March that denied the articles made Ms Stead out to be “reckless” or that she “made stupid investments”, but also argued that “each of those imputations is substantially true”. Aston’s lawyers are yet to address the court.
