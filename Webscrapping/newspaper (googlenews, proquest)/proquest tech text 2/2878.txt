A NEW Covid-19 jab developed in Adelaide has been approved for use in Iran amid claims Australian authorities have “ignored” the study.
Flinders University professor Nikolai Petrovsky, the lead researcher, announced the new deal on Tuesday after successful stage 3 trials.
Prof Petrovsky, who claims he faces the sack from his workplace at Flinders Medical Centre for insisting on only taking his own vaccine, has launched an online crowd-funding scheme to apply to the federal regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
The researcher, who said the federal government had “ignored him”, would not disclose his vaccine’s effectiveness, which foreign govern-ments he was talking with, or what medical journal his results would be published in.
Prof Petrovsky said it would be in use in Iran in the “coming week”. “The one government that seems to have deaf ears is our own,” he said. A federal Health department spokeswoman “categorically rejected” his claims of being ignored.
