MARKET INVESTMENT STRUGGLING small business owners are being encouraged to apply for hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to help give them a much-needed cash injection.
Cloud-based software company Salesforce has teamed up with the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia to roll out almost $700,000 in grants to dozens of businesses to help them overcome the pandemic.
Sixty-seven $10,000 grants are on offer to Australian small businesses to use any way they like. Salesforce’s chief executive Pip Marlow said she hoped the money would help give businesses a “leg up in this tough time”.
“We want to make sure we are being supportive of our small businesses – they can do a number of things with the grant, including marketing or more investing in their customer experience online,” she said.
“Or it could be purchasing some inventory ahead of them reopening, or their operational costs such as rent or paying people.” To be eligible, applicants must be a for-profit business, employ between two and 50 employees, have an annual revenue of $150,000 to $2 million, have been in business for a minimum of two years and have been financially impacted during the coronavirus pandemic.
COSBOA’s chief executive Peter Strong said the grants were fantastic to help small businesses.
“It’s for small businesses going through a hard time and this could make the difference to whether they could reopen or not,” he said. Applications open on Monday, May 25, and close on June 1. To apply, visit cosboa.org.au
