A FLINDERS University chickpea project and University of South Australia space start-up exchange are among recipients of this year’s Australia-India Council (AIC) grants.
Foreign Minister Penny Wong will on Monday announce recipients of the grant program for 2021-22, which marks 75 years of India’s independence and 30 years of the AIC.
Senator Wong said the exchange would “help connect deep technology space companies, providing opportunities for collaboration and fast-tracking market entry and investment”. The chickpea project aims to grow drought-tolerant chickpeas that require less fertiliser. “Australia is the world’s largest exporter of chickpeas, and the Flinders Uni project is aimed at identifying high-performing chickpea variants ... to deliver higher yields for growers both here and in India,” Senator Wong said.
