THE Chinese state is mining data on a global scale to coerce and control public sentiment, including in Australia, a new report has found.
Australia’s relationship with China’s ruling party has been hit by a series of controversies, including the Federal Government’s decision to ban Huawei from the 5G network, concerns over spying and hacking, and political donations scandals.
The Government has also created a University Foreign Interference Taskforce after concerns that Australian partnerships with people or companies linked to the Chinese Communist Party could have undue influence, or even see research benefit the CCP’s military arm, the People’s Liberation Army.
Now, researcher Samantha Hoffman has raised a new issue. In Engineering global consent: The CCP’s data-driven power expansion, she details the CCP’s “ambitious vision” for a “massive and global data collection ecosystem”.
By collecting vast amounts of data from all sorts of devices – such as language translation software – the CCP plans to “generate cooperative and coercive tools of control” through propaganda, the manipulation of public sentiment, and targeted messages.
“When the data is combined with artificial intelligence processing, the result can help build tools that can be used to shape, manage and control, including propaganda tools,” writes Dr Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.Governments must strengthen data privacy laws, promote data transparency and rethink how they deal with foreign propaganda, she says.
