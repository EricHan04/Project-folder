MANY workers may fear a robot taking their job but new research finds they would be more upset if they were replaced by another person.
A study by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Erasmus University in Rotterdam finds millions of jobs will be threatened by robotics and artificial intelligence in coming decades, as computers can do the work more quickly, accurately and/or efficiently than humans.
However, the study finds people would prefer to be replaced by robots than to lose their job to another employee.
It finds most workers have a favourable view of robots or artificial software replacing them in principle, and in the long term, they see machines as being more threatening to their future role in the workforce than other workers.
But when it comes to their own jobs, they would be less upset to see the work go to a robot than someone else.
The study’s authors find people naturally compare themselves less with machines than they do with other people, so being replaced by a robot or software poses less of a threat to their feeling of self-worth and they are more accepting of it.
TUM School of Management professor Christoph Fuchs says understanding the way workers feel can help organisations and the community improve their assistance programs.
“It is important to understand these psychological effects when trying to manage the massive changes in the working world to minimise disruptions in society,” he says.
“For people who have lost their job to a robot, boosting their self-esteem will be less of a priority.“In that case, it is more important to teach them new skills that will reduce their concerns about losing out to robots in the long term.”
