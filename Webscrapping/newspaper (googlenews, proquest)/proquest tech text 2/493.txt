43 Rob Chapman If you want to play six degrees of separation in Adelaide don’t include Rob, because this guy knows everybody. Chapman headed up BankSA for eight years and St George for another two, and since leaving the banking sector in an executive function about 10 years ago has done a bit of everything really. Most would know him as the former chair of the Adelaide Crows – a position he held for 14 years – but he’s also a director of Coopers Brewery, Adelaide Airport and infrastructure company T-Ports. What is less well-known outside the business community is his enthusiastic backing of the start-up community, with investments in more than two dozen firms locally and interstate, including Zero Co – the Byron Bay company with a mission to stamp out single use plastics, and James Podsiadly’s AFL Max operation. His team at Chapman Capital Partners which includes former KPMG boss Con Tragakis and managing director Jennifer Ma, are top of the list for local firms seeking to raise capital or get involved in mergers and acquisitions, and Mr Chapman does it all with an easy affability. 21
