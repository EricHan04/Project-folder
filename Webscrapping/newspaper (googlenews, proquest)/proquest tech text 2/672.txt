VICTORIA SOCIAL ENTERPRISE FOUNDER UNLIKE other teenagers, university student Nathaniel Diong, 19, was busily helping young Australians create new career pathways after many lost their jobs last year.
His social enterprise, Future Minds Network, has provided thousands of struggling youths with the skills they needed to re-enter the workforce.
“I wish people would realise that young people are innovative, compassionate and tenacious enough to change the world,” Mr Diong said.
“They just need the right tools and frameworks to actualise their ideas.” The Pride of Australia – Thanks A Million winner also linked 10,000 disadvantaged women in tech with employment and helped struggling businesses navigate a COVID-world across 30 different start-up programs.
“The best part of my work is seeing the light-bulb moment when young people realise the true impact that they can make,” Mr Diong said.
“Seeing them more positive, confident and resourceful when they start building their projects outside of the program is amazing. Many of our alumni have since landed jobs at UNICEF, managed companies with 50 employees and gained financial freedom. “Students leave with a growth mindset, knowing talents can be developed through hard work. They leave more positive, creative and resilient.”
