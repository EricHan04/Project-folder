LEG 1 RACE 6 LIGHTHOUSE (2) just wins, surely? Could make a case for the American mare to be in one-out in the first leg of the quadrella but if we had to be picky the extra weight and sticking to 1400m could make the big grey mare a bit vulnerable. BERMADEZ (4) will be running on strong – whether the Tavistock gelding can bridge the gap to Lighthouse remains to be seen. Won four of seven starts and has Damien Oliver in the saddle.
1ST LEG 2, 4 LEG 2 RACE 7 HALVORSEN (1) loves Flemington and last-start track and trip winner. SARTORIAL SPLENDOR (2) will be in front a long way, even though the weight could stop him late. Four-year-old mares MILEVA (6) and CAPRICCIO (14) should be near each other in the run and finishing strongly. TEQUILA TIME (11) looking for a hat-trick and Jamie Kah wouldn’t be riding unless the Adelaide visitor truly was flying.
2ND LEG 1, 2, 6, 11, 14 LEG 3 RACE 8 ROYAL MILE (1) will need luck from the wide draw but tends to roll forward and make own luck. SIGN OF USSURI (3) was fourth in a blanket finish at Ballarat last start. Form prior reads – second, first, first, third and fourth. Should be somewhere in the finish. FIFTH POSITION (10) is chasing an elusive Australian win after placing in three of six local starts. Drawn poorly again. Include FIVE KINGDOM (12) as the knockout chance.
3RD LEG 1, 3, 10, 12 LEG 4 RACE 9 SIXBYSIXTYTHREE (8) has a perfect record – three from three – to protect after wins at Pakenham (twice) and Echuca. Drawn on the right side of the track to be winning and in astute hands. KENTUCKY CASANOVA (13) was impressive winning at Sandown Lakeside last start. Up in grade but not an exceptionally deep Saturday sprint this. PROPER ROGUE (2) resumed with a very nice third at big odds at Ballarat after 14 months off. Has won at Flemington previously.
