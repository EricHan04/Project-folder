ARTIFICIAL intelligence will replace 69 per cent of a manager’s workload by 2024, but it will enable them to spend more time managing staff.
Research and advisory firm Gartner predicts technologies such as virtual personal assistants and chatbots can transform the role of managers, and will become more widespread in the next four years.
Its research vice-president Helen Poitevin said the tools could be used to complete tasks such as filling in forms, updating information and approving workflows.
“By using AI to automate these tasks, they can spend less time managing transactions and can invest more time on learning, performance management and goal setting,” she said.
Gartner HR adviser Robin Boomer said AI could enhance rather than replace jobs, help workers to focus and perhaps take over some parts of the job that many workers found challenging, such as giving constructive feedback.
“AI allows workers to focus on the most engaging and enjoyable parts of their jobs leading to higher work quality, improved productivity and engagement and increased creativity,” he said.
“If you’re working on something that’s not aligned to your KPI, AI can step in and say, ‘I notice you’ve been working on a task that isn’t a high priority for the week, what you should be doing is focusing on this task instead’.
“AI can remove the emotional response of receiving constructive feedback, improving overall workplace culture.” It could also improve work/life balance and prevent burnout.
