SURELY the Australian Federal Police have more important things to do than watch The Bachelor. Clearly not.
Confidential is taken aback by an AFP tweet directed at Adelaide Bachelor hunk Matt Agnew that doubled as a recruitment drive.
“A message for @TheBachelorAU after last night’s ep,” the tweet read. “Matt – if the career in astrophysics/data analytics and finding eternal love doesn’t pan out, we’d be happy to help you with your detective skills. Register your interest to join the AFP anytime!” The Twitter post, above, which included a link to AFP recruitment followed Wednesday night’s episode of The Bachelor where Matt embarked on somewhat of an investigative mission when he was informed one of his female admirers had been bitching behind his back.
During a date with Abbie, he was told that fellow bachelorette Monique had called him a “disrespectful pig” and a “dog c..t”.
Monique has been sent packing from the Bachelor mansion but claims her comments were merely a joke taken out of context.
State and Federal law enforcement agencies have increasingly upped lighter hearted posts on social media in addition to dealing with serious issues like drug hauls and murder arrests.
The AFP has just under 30,000 followers on Twitter and a further 430,000 on Facebook while SA Police Twitter currently sits at 149,000.
AFP Senior Social Media Officer Laura Haddock has reportedly said she works in a media team of 10 unsworn officers who work carefully on posts before they are shared.
“Getting the AFP voice takes everyone in the team,” Laura told the ABC. “People would be surprised at the amount of work that goes into what seems like a flyaway post.“I sense-check just about everything and get the team’s ideas on whether that’s going to fly. It’s always good to get a couple of opinions.”
