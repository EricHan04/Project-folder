Facebook has blocked the pages of Queensland Health and SA Health amid a row over proposed media ownership laws.
The Queensland Health and South Australia Health pages have been blocked on Facebook after the social media giant banned Australians sharing news.
The pages, which provide crucial government health information and advice about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, were blocked on Monday morning.
A Queensland government spokesman told AAP the matter will be investigated and Facebook will be contacted.
Comment has been sought from the South Australian government.
More than 600,000 people follow the Queensland Health page and more than 307,000 follow the SA Health page.
No other government health department pages have been banned.
Facebook has followed through on its threat to ban Australians sharing news on its platform in response to a proposed media bargaining code.
Australian users and publishers will be restricted from sharing or viewing domestic and international news.
