ADELAIDE start-up Lumin Sports Technology has raised close to $300,000 to help commercialise its sports technology and analytics platforms.
The company has secured $148,000 from the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, adding to $140,000 it has raised in seed funding from investors.
Backed by former AFL stars James Begley and Matthew Pavlich, Lumin collects and analyses sports data to provide insights for athletes and sporting teams.
Lumin platforms Phila and ARC track, analyse and report on the health and wellness of athletes through smartphones and other hardware.
Lumin chief executive Ben Tripodi said the funding would be used to hire new staff, build out the platforms and deliver a suite of products to sporting organisations across the world.
He said the company had already fielded interest from a number of teams in the US National Football League (NFL).
“Sporting organisations continue to capture more and more data, but until now have struggled to make sense of it, or don’t have the man power to drive accurate decisions from it,” he said.
“We improve this workflow, make sense of the data and deliver it to each decision-maker in real time.
“We can analyse everything from sleeping habits to lifestyle and even the increase in pain levels of certain injuries, and we make that data easy to access and understand for sports organisations looking to help their athletes stay healthy and maximise their performances and wellbeing for longer.”Lumin is currently working with Adelaide Crows high performance general manager Matt Hass, who is using Phila and ARC to track the wellness of players. It is also working with Boston University’s NCAA track and field squad, the Australian Olympic cycling program and a number of professional cycling teams.
