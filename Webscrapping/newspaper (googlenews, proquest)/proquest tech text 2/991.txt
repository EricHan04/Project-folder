AN Adelaide financial adviser embroiled in the collapse of money transfer start-up Bux Global has copped a six-year ban from the corporate watchdog.
ASIC found Adrian John Cassidy acted dishonestly by concealing investment advice from his licensee – NAB subsidiary Godfrey Pembroke. In 2017 Mr Cassidy made recommendations to 54 clients to invest in start-up company Bux Global. After discovering the recommendations were concealed from Godfrey Pembroke, Mr Cassidy’s conduct was reported to ASIC by NAB.
He will be prevented from providing financial services for the duration of his ban.ASIC also found Mr Cassidy had failed to act in his clients’ best interests, and failed to provide them with a statement of advice regarding Bux Global. Bux Global, a Sydney-based start-up, received more than $65 million from investors before it was placed into liquidation in October 2018. Mr Cassidy has appealed ASIC’s decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A hearing date is yet to be set.
