JP’s breakout moment came when the Drakes Supermarkets director expressed quite exquisitely the community’s frustration with toilet paper hoarders during pandemic-related panic buying, not only refusing to give a refund to one obnoxious human who bought $10,000 worth of toilet paper and a bucket load of sanitiser, but also flipping him the bird on his regular retail wrap on YouTube.
The video not surprisingly went viral, having clocked up more than 600,000 views to date, and exposed many of us for the first time to JP’s entertaining, well-considered, and often quite funny retail wraps he publishes regularly on LinkedIn.
Mr Drake is now considered an influencer on the business social media platform and speaks frankly about issues such as mandating vaccines for staff, start-up investing, and what determines success working in a large family business.
He also backed former Crows player Brad Moran’s start-up CitrusAd, which sold recently for $205m, probably making a pretty penny in the process. DEBUT
