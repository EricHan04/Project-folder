NEW training opportunities are regularly being introduced for nurses, amid severe worker shortages in every area of speciality.
Graduate certificate qualifications in cosmetic and dermatology nursing were recently introduced for the first time in Australia, with training in digital health and medical imaging to be offered soon.
Australian College of Nursing chief executive Adjunct Professor Kylie Ward says Australia holds the “remarkable’’ position of having one of the highest number of specialty areas for nurses in the world.
“We offer almost 21 specialties in nursing, including renal nursing, palliative care, cosmetic nursing – even regional and remote nursing,’’ Ward says.
“I would say there wouldn’t be a (specialist nursing) area that exists that wasn’t experiencing a (worker) shortage.’’ Ward says the shortage of specialist nurses comes despite an oversupply of nursing graduates.
She says early-career nurses should specialise in whatever areas are available to them, advising there is always the opportunity to move to another specialty later.
McGrath Foundation chief executive Holly Masters says there is a dire shortage of breast cancer nurses.
Before COVID-19, the foundation estimated an extra 107 breast care nurses – more than two-thirds of thecurrent workforce – were needed to meet demand.
The number is now expected to be much greater as the pandemic forced the closure of breast screening clinics around the country, leading to crucial delays in detection and treatment. Masters says continual improvements in treatment means ongoing training is essential for breast care nurses, with the foundation recently partnering with educational technology provider Androgogic to provide nurses with access to e-Learning opportunities.
