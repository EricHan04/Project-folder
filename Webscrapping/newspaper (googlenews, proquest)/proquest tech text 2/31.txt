At a glance At Sky Stadium, Wellington: Wellington Phoenix 1 (Ben Waine 75') Adelaide United 1 (Ben Halloran 90+3'). HT: 0-0.
Wellington Phoenix were seconds away from pulling off an unlikely win in their opening game of the A-League Men season.
But they conceded in the 93rd minute to draw 1-1 with Adelaide United in a match where they played most of it with just 10 men.
New signing Yan Sasse's debut lasted just 25 minutes after the Brazilian playmaker was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Javi Lopez.
Sasse looked distraught as he walked from the pitch,the first A-League player in nine years to be sent off on debut.
The incident occurred when Sasse and Lopez challenged for a waist-high ball with outstretched legs.
But with one leg raised, Sasse's planted foot slipped and he ended up scything his opponent's ankle, leaving referee Ben Abraham with no choice but to brandish the red card.
Despite playing with a man down, the Phoenix created better chances in the second half.
Oskar Zawada got on the end of a long ball from Nicholas Pennington and cut inside two defenders but his shot was tame and easily saved.
They looked on track to register their first opening round win since the 2018-19 season when substitute Ben Waine netted his first goal at Sky Stadium to give them the lead in the 75th minute. Waine seized on a loose ball in the box after the initial shot from Kosta Barbarouses was spilled by Joe Gauci.
But the under-manned Phoenix were unable to hang on.
They conceded off a corner in the third minute of stoppage time, with Ben Halloran tucking home a low-driven shot at the back post to snatch a dramatic late equaliser.
All six new Phoenix signings were named the starting XI with Zawada getting the nod to start up front ahead of Waine.
Lucas Mauragis took the place of injured left-back Sam Sutton, ruled out with a hamstring niggle.
