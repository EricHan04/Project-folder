ACTING Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles will visit the Edinburgh Defence Precinct on Friday to launch a supercomputing ­facility.
The first of its kind in the country, the high-performance computing capability will play a vital role in the design, development and analysis of modern weapon systems and national security.
It will allow defence scientists to analyse large data sets, providing a platform to tackle some of the sector’s most challenging scientific and engineering problems.
Further, it will support the nation’s AUKUS priorities, ­including nuclear submarines and artificial intelligence, as well as quantum technologies.
Mr Marles, pictured, said data was critical to much of the work done by defence scientists.
“But, even more important than the data itself, is the ability to rapidly and reliably analyse and process that data,” he said.
“This high-performance computing facility provides a secure and sovereign capability to do just that.” The new infrastructure has been given the name Taingiwilta – which means “powerful” in the language of the Kaurna people.
