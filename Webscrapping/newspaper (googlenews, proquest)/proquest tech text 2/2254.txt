A $1.7 MILLION “smart precinct” capable of directing motorists toward empty car parks, free Wi-Fi and mobile charging points will be built in Adelaide’s south.
The Marion council has revealed it will install new smart technology in a 16ha area between Oaklands Crossing and Diagonal Rd. The technology will direct motorists toward vacant street parking while touch screens will inform pedestrians about local facilities and businesses. A new playground equipped with sensors to record how often each piece of equipment is used will be built at Dwyer Road Reserve.Design and planning for the pilot project will begin soon and the technology is expected to be introduced by mid-2020.
