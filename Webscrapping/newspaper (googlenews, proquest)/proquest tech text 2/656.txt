TWO thousand entrepreneurial youths will be offered 12-month loans worth up to $11,300 under a Labor plan to turn their big ideas into big businesses.
In his budget reply speech tonight, Anthony Albanese will unveil “Start-up Year”, an initiative designed to match graduating tertiary students with universities and private-sector incubators to help commercialise their inventions.
“It is Australian start-ups in areas like manufacturing, medicine, IT and clean energy that will build the Australian industries of tomorrow whilst also solving some of our toughest domestic and global challenges,” Mr Albanese said.
The taxpayer-funded support will be provided through the existing university loan system to cover the costs associated in young people participating in accredited programs. They will receive mentoring and professional development to work on their ideas and create sustainable businesses out of them.
