THREE-quarters of workers are open to learning skills so their workplace can take advantage of artificial intelligence. Almost every Australian executive (99 per cent) surveyed for Genpact’s second research series AI 360 says their company plans to implement AI-related technologies in the next three years.
An improved customer experience, greater interdepartmental collaboration, and freeing up workers’ time to focus on important tasks are the most commonly anticipated benefits.
Genpact Australia country manager Richard Morgan says the research finds Australians are the most fearful when it comes to believing AI threatens their jobs, as well as those of future generations.
However, workers expect to see benefits from AI in the next three years, and 77 per cent are open to learning skills so they can take advantage of it.
“Executives must educate their employees and customers about AI’s potential, and provide them with tools to take advantage of its benefits,” he says. “Many companies see AI’s benefits, and we expect to see this grow in Australia as more businesses learn from the early adopters, and as more customers and employees better understand the benefits of AI on their lives.
“Yet people still worry about such issues as AI bias and privacy, and fear AI’s impact on jobs. These doubts send clear signals about what companies must address to achieve business impact from AI.” The survey finds 53 per cent of consumers globally say AI is making their lives better, up from one-third when the last survey was undertaken in 2017.However, just 43 per cent of Australians believe it is improving their lives compared to 48 per cent of UK workers and 59 per cent of people in the US.
