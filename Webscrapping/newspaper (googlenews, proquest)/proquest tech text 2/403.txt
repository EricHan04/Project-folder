AUSTRALIA has lost more than 100,000 foreign students in the past financial year at a cost of nearly $6bn to the economy.
Higher education leaders warn the sector will not recover from any further Covid-19 induced delays.
New federal government data shows there are more than 472,000 holders of Australian student visas, including those inside and outside the country, compared with more than 595,000 at the same time in 2020.
Overall commencements at Australian universities by foreign students have fallen 35 per cent from their peak in 2019, and 21.8 per cent in the year to April.
The Delta outbreaks across Australia have already forced NSW to indefinitely pause its plan to bring small batches of foreign students into the state, but locked-down South Australia is still aiming to proceed with its international student pilot programs.
International Education Association chief executive Phil Honeywood said the industry’s ability to bounce back from a year of pain looked dim.
“Political bravery to revive the beleaguered $40bn international education industry appears to now be lacking across all states except South Australia,” he said.
“The whole point of the states’ pilot student return plans is to show the wider Australian community that these young people can be brought back safely to resume their long-delayed studies. Now we are not … permitted to prove that this model can work.
“In the meantime, as … marketing, admissions and student services staff continue to be made redundant, there is real concern about the industry’s ability to dust itself off and quickly start up again.” Government data shows more than 60,000 student visa holders in the university sector have dropped off in the past year. More than 20,000 have lapsed in vocational education.
The figures also showed a significant drop in the number of student visa holders attending English language schools, with more than 3000 this month compared with more than 19,000 the previous July.
More than 313,000 student visa holders are in Australia and more than 158,000 are outside the country. At this point last year, there were about 471,000 student visa holders in Australia and 124,000 outside the country.
The International Education Association estimates each student lost in the 2020-21 cohort is worth $60,000 to the Australian economy. The Australian
