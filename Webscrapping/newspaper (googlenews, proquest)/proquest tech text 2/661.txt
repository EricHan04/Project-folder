PRINCE Harry has a new day job, with a senior position at a Silicon Valley start-up.
His role as chief impact officer with online coaching and mental health company BetterUp Inc was announced yesterday. It is understood he could receive a seven-figure salary for the role.
“I intend to help create impact in people’s lives,” Prince Harry told The Wall St Journal. He said he had been using the BetterUp product for several months.
“I was matched with my coach who, quite frankly, is truly awesome and has always given me sound advice and a fresh perspective, which is so valuable,” he said.
Harry recently told Oprah Winfrey that he had been “cut off” financially from the royals since moving to the US with wife Meghan and son Archie. He said was surviving on media deals he had signed with Spotify and Netflix as well as the $17m from his late mother Diana’s estate.
