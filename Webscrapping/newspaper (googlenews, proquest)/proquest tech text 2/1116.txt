AN ABORIGINAL language could hold the key to solving some of the most ­challenging communication problems ­between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems.
A new paper explains how Jingulu – a language spoken by the Jingili people in the NT – has characteristics that allow it to be easily translated into AI commands. Professor Hussein Abbass from UNSW Canberra said Jingulu was unique, even among Aboriginal lang­uages. With just three verbs – come, go and do – it effectively communicated ­spatial movements.
