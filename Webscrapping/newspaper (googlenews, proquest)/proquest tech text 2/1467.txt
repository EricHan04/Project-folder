INVASIVE species cost Australia $25 billion each year and without urgent action that figure will spiral out of control in the coming decades, a new report reveals.
Launched by the CSIRO and Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, the report highlights the need for emerging biosecurity technologies to be fast tracked to control invasive pests, which have cost the nation $390b across the past six decades.
Agriculture is bearing the brunt of that cost - weeds alone cost the industry at least $5b a year. But there are existing technologies that could turn the tide.
Real-time satellites and drones can track pests in isolated locations, while artificial intelligence can be used to create a high-speed camera to spot roadside weeds or a robot that identifies and physically removes weeds on farms.
The report recommends pouring money into biosecurity research to create an "innovation pipeline".
