TECHNOLOGY giant Salesforce and the South Australian Venture Capital Fund are am­ong investors that have tipped $17m into Adelaide health software start-up Lumary.
The funding round, led by venture capital firm OneVentures with a majority investment, will be used to accelerate the company’s overseas expansion, including the launch of Lumary’s platforms into the lucrative US market.
Tech entrepreneurs Joseph Mercorella and Matthew English established Lumary in 2017 after identifying a need for new software to manage the complex relationships between providers, consumers and others participating in the NDIS.
It has since developed a range of Salesforce-backed workflow management and other digital platforms, offering disability and aged care providers an “end-to-end” system for scheduling, resourcing, accounting, document management, communication and reporting.
Mr Mercorella, the company’s chief executive, said the company had processed more than $2.5bn in NDIS services through its software platform for more than 200,000 users.
“Having the strategic expertise and financial support of OneVentures, Salesforce Ventures, and the State Government through the SAVCF will help us execute our vision even more rapidly,” he said.
“Lumary is proud to be leading the way for other tech companies in SA to build and stay, even when their growth goes global.” Lumary is the fifth investment by the SAVCF.
