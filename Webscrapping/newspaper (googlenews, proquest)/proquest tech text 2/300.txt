ADELAIDE start-up ValAi is in talks with investors to fast-track development of its sustainability valuation platform, Greenhouse, after winning a global competition run by international banks.
Greenhouse encourages homeowners to invest in sustainability upgrades, such as smart meters, solar and batteries, by measuring and reporting the impact of sustainability performance on a property’s value.
It’s the brainchild of Conservation Council SA general manager Allys Todd and property valuer Tom Reed, who have been developing the platform over the past 18 months. They hope it will also influence banks and financiers to recognise both the environmental and financial benefits of sustainable properties. Last week, Greenhouse took out the inaugural Global Open Finance Challenge – a competition run by NAB, Canada’s CIBC, Brazil’s Itau Unibanco and the UK’s NatWest to encourage innovation in the sector.
