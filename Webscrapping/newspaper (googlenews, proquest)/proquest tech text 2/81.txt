SOME farmers in the Northern and Yorke Landscapes Board region haven't "had a cash crop for up to five years", prompting the start-up of a drought resilience project to help those farming along Goyder's Line.
The project was among many drought-related activities and innovations showcased during a national online forum this week, which included a live cross to SA's new Drought Hub headquarters at Roseworthy.
SA Drought Hub director Stephen Lee said the federal government's Future Drought Fund Science to Practice Forum - livestreamed across Australia on Tuesday and Wednesday - provided an unique opportunity for South Australians to come together to learn about the various initiatives being undertaken nationally and within SA to prepare for drought.
On Tuesday, the jam-packed online program ended at the Roseworthy campus, where participants were introduced to some of the people and partners behind the SA Drought Hub - one of eight hubs established across the nation in 2021 through the Future Drought Fund.
This included NYLB sustainable agricultural officer Taryn Mangelsdorf, who outlined drought-related issues within her region and how the NYLB had been working collaboratively with the community and farming sector to develop meaningful projects that build resilience to drought, particularly in the Robertstown district, where a lack of services had been identified.
Today (Thursday), a local drought-relevant field trip is also being held across the Mid North and Barossa Valley as part of the program.
Attendees will visit local drought resilience initiatives such as commercial hay and fodder production and drought storage at Ezy Bale in Freeling; the use of mulches and composts to benefit soils and wine grape production at Pindarie winery; and a variety of sheep management tools to increase ewe and ram fertility and weaning rates at Turretfield Research Centre.
