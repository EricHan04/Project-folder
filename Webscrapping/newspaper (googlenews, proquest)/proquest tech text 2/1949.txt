HIGH-TECH analysis of your tennis game will be available to players worldwide from this week when the Adelaide-developed Tennis AI program launches on Friday.
Professional players have been using game analysis to improve their performance for years, however, a high-quality, fast and affordable digital solution has not been available for players below the elite level until now.
Developed by Dr David To and his team at Athlete’s AI, the Tennis AI program, which was used at the inaugural ATP Cup in January this year, uses a smartphone camera coupled with artificial intelligence analytics to provide a stroke-by-stroke breakdown of a player’s game.
Dr To said the program would cost just $10 per month for amateurs, while access for their coaches would be free.
“For the players, it means they can access coaches anywhere in the world,’’ he said.
“They can have their coach review their match remotely, and they can filter really efficiently to specific points or specific strokes of the match and also the ball bouncing contact point and see the trends there.’’ The program will be available from tennisai.com.au.
