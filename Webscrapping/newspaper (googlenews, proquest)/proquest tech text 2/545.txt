A 346-hectare (855-acre) property located on the Northern Yorke Peninsula is well suited to mixed farming and has hit the market and is being offered as a whole or in two contingent lots.
Situated approximately three kilometres east of Mundoora and 17 kilometres east of Port Broughton, Stringers offers a great opportunity to add scale to an existing enterprise or could be the ideal mixed-farming start up operation.
Lot 1 of Stringers is known as The Back Block and comprises a total land area of 151ha (373ac) with approximately 149ha (369ac) arable.
Lot 1 is fenced into four main paddocks with the land comprising a mix of sandy loam soils which are well suited to the local climate and is relatively flat and easy working land.
Lot 2 known as The Front Block has a total area of 195ha (483ac) with a total arable area of 193ha (477ac).
The Front Block is well improved with a three-stand shearing shed with steel yards, an implement shed, hay shed, workshop and three fixed grain silos.
Lot 2 is fenced into five main paddocks with red/brown loam soils with gentle to moderate undulation.
The Front Block is well suited to cropping or mixed farming.
The average annual rainfall for the property is approximately 325mm and when combined with a mix of sandy loams and reddish-brown soils, makes this land highly productive and able to grow a wide variety of crops.
"With interest rates at record lows, livestock prices at record highs and strong commodity prices, this well improved property is certainly worth consideration," selling agent Martin Stringer said.
"It offers scale as a whole or an opportunity of a manageable size parcel for farm build up or investment."
Stringers is being offered for sale by way of auction to be held in the Mundoora Club at 3pm, Friday, October 1.
Inspections are strictly by appointment only and can be made by contacting the selling agents.
