BILLIONAIRES, executives and sports stars are among those who have poured money into a new online marketplace for Australian-made goods by Australian-owned businesses.
Buy Aussie Now was launched last year with a $1m raising led by caravans magnate Gerry Ryan.
It has just closed a $2.3m raising which values the start-up at more than $14m just 10 months after launching.
Australian limited overs cricket captain Aaron Finch, retired Hawthorn AFL star Jarryd Roughead and Queensland Reds rugby union player James O’Connor have invested in the marketplace.
Finch said he invested in Buy Aussie Now because he wanted to support Australian businesses. “It is local and I come from a regional area so I can understand the importance of that,” he said.
Other investors include ex-Swisse Vitamins boss Radek Sali and ex Myer executive and footwear label founder Joanne Mercer.
Buy Aussie Now was started by former Swisse executive Mitch Catlin and its chief executive, Chris White. at the height of the COVID lockdown last year as a facilitator to convince more Australians to buy locally made products.
Mr Catlin said the group received a strong response from businesses wanting to sell on the platform but the surge in numbers meant it has needed investment.
“We’ve got a loyal customer base but we do need to improve the technology behind us, which is what this raising will do,” he said. “Our repeat purchase rate (from existing customers) is about 20 per cent, which means our engagement level is really high.” Buy Aussie Now already has 1200 small and medium-sized firms on its marketplace and 7000 businesses have registered to take part. It sells about 25,000 products across nine categories.
