THE Adelaide University’s Australian Institute of Machine Learning is raising awareness about the prominence of artificial intelligence in everyday lives and the impact it will have in future at two separate events today.
Resisting technology advances is futile, Anton van den Hengel, director of AIML, will tell an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch today. “The reality is that technologies like internet of things, artificial intelligence and quantum computing are impacting our economy already, and the changes have just begun,” he said.
“Each of these technologies has the capacity to be economically disruptive, both globally, and for South Australia specifically.”At a separate event at the Adelaide City Library, AIML adjunct professor Dr Jamie Sherrah will discuss how he is putting AI at the heart of a Canadian company’s efforts to help consumers find shoes that fit perfectly. As a chief scientist at FTSY, he is helping making shopping for shoes easy and fun, and will provide a technical overview of how the app works. “I am helping them with the right algorithm to enable better measurements and matching of shoes,” he said.
