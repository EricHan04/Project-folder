WOOLWORTHS is launching a new online marketplace to widen its reach in the fast growing $10 billion-plus health and wellness sector.
The move will see the supermarket giant provide digital health services and advice for the first time under one retail banner.
The online business, called HealthyLife, will appeal to the growing legions of Australian consumers who are increasingly opting for healthy food choices, as well as seeking guidance on a range of wellness and fitness needs.
According to Woolworths’ internal data there has been an 80 per cent uptake in digital traffic on health-related searches across a range of categories on the retailer’s websites as shoppers search for healthy snacks and recipes, vitamins, supplements and preventive medicines for colds and flu.
The HealthyLife start-up will provide a range of services and advice, fitness and nutrition tracking, vitamins, sports nutrition, along with a specialised range of natural and organic products not currently offered by Woolworths. “We’re establishing HealthyLife online to ensure we provide our customers with a convenient destination to meet their health and wellness needs,” said Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci (inset). Woolworths shares closed 11c lower at $41.79 on Wednesday.
