FEARLESS CONVERSATIONS INNOVATIVE EDUCATION PEDAGOGY
MODERN classrooms must remain focused on developing “first-class humans” rather than “second-class robots” as new technologies are embraced, says the state’s education boss.
SA Education Department chief executive Martin Westwell, speaking at this week’s Flinders University and The Advertiser Fearless Conversations forum on innovative education and pedagogy, said students needed to answer “ungoogleable questions”.
“Google can answer ‘googleable’ questions, our phones can answer ‘googleable’ questions ... you still need knowledge,” he said.
“No one thrives just saying, ‘everything is on Google’.
“You still need knowledge, you still need skills ... we don’t want to be equipping our young people to just compete with the robots (but) focusing on developing first-class humans.” Prof Westwell, the former head of the SACE board, said teachers were increasingly focusing on developing children’s critical and creative thinking, as well as building social and interpersonal skills.
He said artificial intelligence and machine learning, already being used in some school settings, would inevitably become more commonplace in classrooms but getting the balance between technology and real person interaction was a work in progress.
“It’s a new challenge for our students and a new challenge for our educators ... how do we use this technology, not just to get information but to support deep understanding in our students?” he said. “I think, as a supportive technology, there’s something in AI to help educators.”
