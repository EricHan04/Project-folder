PROPERTY data and analytics company PointData has laun­ched a new valuation platform built on the back of its artificial intelligence technology.
Known as Valeri, the platform draws on a wide range of datasets to learn neighbourhood patterns and, according to PointData chief executive George Giannakodakis, improves the accuracy and reliability of automated valuation models.
He said Valeri had been developed primarily for the property development, real estate, and finance industries.
“We are pleased to offer Valeri as a timesaving and revenue-boosting property-val­uation tool to businesses across the Adelaide area,” he said.
“While there are other platforms in the marketplace, our data has been shown to be more accurate, more often.
“Subdivision potential is also a new feature within the Valeri platform that will save builders, developers, real estate agents, and even homeowners and buyers a considerable amount of time and money, giving them access to data on over 105,000 development sites in Adelaide.” Users of Valeri can generate a range of industry reports, including property value reports, vendor listing and market profile reports, and property development potential reports.
Subscribers can also access information about a property’s sales history, price estimates, possible subdivision potential, neighbourhood metrics, and soil and cracking risk.
Last year, PointData struck a deal with Land Services SA, which resulted in its property-valuation reports being distributed through the state’s lands titles platform. Mr Giannakodakis said Point­Data was also expanding its range to include house and land-matching, super lot analysis, new house and land value appraisals and data packs for off-market sites. As part of Valeri’s launch, PointData is offering a free two-week trial.
