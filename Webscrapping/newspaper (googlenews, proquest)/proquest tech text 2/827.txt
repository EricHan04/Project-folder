The state government is calling for submissions of suitable products to showcase as it establishes a new AgTech demonstration site at Minnipa.
The Minnipa Agricultural Centre is among the sites being included as part of the $2.4-million regional AgTech demonstration farms and start-up hubs project.
The AgTech Strategic Plan is aimed to encourage South Australia's primary producers to further adopt technology to increase productivity and profitability.
Primary Industries Minister David Basham said opening up the centre as the new AgTech demonstration site would help show the value of technology to farmers and producers in the region.
"The Minnipa Research Centre has been one of Australia's leading dryland research sites for many years and the addition of AgTech on-farm will be important as the facility continues to move forward," he said.
Expressions of interest are now open for the AgTech demonstration site at Minnipa. For more details and to apply, visit pir.sa.gov.au/agtech-eoi.
