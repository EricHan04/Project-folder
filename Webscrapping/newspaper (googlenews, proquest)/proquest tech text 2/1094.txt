ARTIFICIAL intelligence technology will be used in pop-up clinics in rural areas to improve early detection of skin cancers.
Nurses will use dermatoscopes equipped with the technology in clinics held at community events to make it as easy as possible for people to get checked, including farming families in town for events such as field days and festivals.
The dermatoscope is a non-invasive handheld instrument that takes digital photographs of lesions.
Images from the dermatoscopes will be forwarded to regional GPs and/or dermatologists for assessment.
The project is being supported by a $125,000 grant from The Hospital Research Foundation.
Regional nurses will be trained to use the technology with support from Skin Smart Australia and local GP clinics, for the pop-up clinics starting next year.
Project leader Marion Eckert, director of the Rosemary Bryant AO Research Centre at the University of South Australia, said new A.I. technologies were expanding the health system’s capabilities for early detection. “A.I. can act as an assistant for overloaded doctors in diagnosing skin cancers,” she said. The pop-up clinics will be at the SA Wooden Boat Festival at Victor Harbor in April 2023; Yorke Peninsula Field Days, Paskerville, September 2023; Riverland Field Days, September 2023; and Coober Pedy Opal Festival, June 2024.
