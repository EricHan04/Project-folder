A University of Adelaide expert has been named as the South Australian Young Tall Poppy of the Year for their work to help ensure food security for future generations.
Tatiana Soares da Costa is one of five of the University's early career researchers who have received 2022 South Australian Young Tall Poppy Science Awards.
University of Adelaide's Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Anton Middelberg said Dr Soares da Costa joins Jiawen Li, Zohra Lassi, Qi Wu and Erinn Fagan-Jeffries in being recognised for their "innovative research to combat challenges faced by society and ultimately improve people's lives".
"Their wide-ranging work focuses on a number of different areas, including agriculture, artificial intelligence and biology," he said.
Dr Soares da Costa is a Future Making Fellow and lab head from the School of Agriculture, Food and Wine.
She leads a multidisciplinary research team dedicated to discovering new and safe herbicides that are less prone to developing resistance.
Her group uses innovative, time and cost-effective strategies to expedite bringing herbicides to the market to ensure food security for future generations.
"(The award) is a great recognition of the work my team and I are doing at the Waite Research Institute and the community outreach I am passionately engaged in," she said. "I look forward to continuing to share my love of science and inspire the next generation of young scientists."
