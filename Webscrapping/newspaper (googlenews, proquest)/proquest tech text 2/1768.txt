A $7.7 million federal government investment in mining research centres at the universities of Sydney and Adelaide will help boost quality assurance, maximise resource recovery and use the data science skills needed to decide how to best use Australia’s natural resources.
The Australian Research Council Industrial Transformation Training Centre grants will add to university and commercial investment.
At Adelaide, which received $3.7m, the new Centre for Integrated Operations for Complex Resources adds to $2m of university funds and $6.8m in-kind from partners.
The aim is to train scientists and engineers to use advanced sensors, data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to increase certainty of product quality and increase productivity.Sydney’s $3.9m grant will help establish an $11m Data Analytics for Resources and Environments Centre to enable researchers to “apply their data science models against real world challenges, such as water storage, biodiversity loss and the extraction of mineral resources”.
