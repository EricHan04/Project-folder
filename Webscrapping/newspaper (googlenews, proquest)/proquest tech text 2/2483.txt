NEW findings from Australian researchers have endorsed what millions of people around the world believe: fitness trackers, pedometers and smart watches motivate us to exercise more and lose weight.
Wearable activity trackers encourage us to walk up to 40 minutes more each day (about 1800 more steps), resulting in an average 1kg weight loss over five months.
Researchers from the University of South Australia reviewed almost 400 studies involving 164,000 people across the world using wearable activity trackers (WATs) to monitor their physical activity.
Their findings, published in Lancet Digital Health, underline the value of low-cost interventions to tackle a growing epidemic of health conditions partially caused by a lack of exercise, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers, and mental illness.
Lead researcher and UniSA PhD candidate Ty Ferguson said despite the popularity of WATs, there was widespread scepticism about their effectiveness, accuracy, and whether they fuelled obsessive behaviours and eating disorders, but the evidence was overwhelmingly positive.
“The overall results from the studies we reviewed shows that wearable activity trackers are effective across all age groups and for long periods of time,” Mr Ferguson said. “They encourage people to exercise on a regular basis, to make it part of their routine and to set goals to lose weight.”The 1kg weight loss may not seem a lot, but researchers say from a public health perspective it is meaningful.
