FAMOUS sporting moments featuring football star Eddie Betts and soccer star John Aloisi, pictured, will spearhead the release of what are believed to be among the first Australian non-fungible tokens (NFT) to be launched locally.
Aloisi and Betts feature in the Australian section of a marketplace led by global blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure provider Binance.
NFTs such as digital art and collectables surged in popularity this year. The items often are traded using cryptocurrency. Verification via blockchain makes digital goods unique and provides proof of authenticity, which makes them attractive to buyers.
Binanceâ€™s 100 Creators campaign will be launched via auction this week, including eight Australians from sport, photography, art and other unique content. The Aloisi and Betts NFTs will be issued as unique trading cards created by a local artist to capture their most famous moments.
