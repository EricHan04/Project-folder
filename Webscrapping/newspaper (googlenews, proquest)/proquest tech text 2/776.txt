A FINGER prick blood test may soon be able to show if a person has concussion within minutes of an injury.
The Australian development is hoped to clear the way for sports players to return to the field within minutes of a head knock, or identify those suffering brain injuries so they can be safely managed. Following the discovery of telltale biomarkers that can be detected in the blood of concussion victims, Melbourne’s Alfred Hospital has undertaken early trials as proof of concept for a finger prick test — similar to those used to measure blood sugar.
The high-level research is being funded by the Australian Defence Force in the hope it can help injured soldiers return to the battlefield. The US military is also trialling the technology being developed by The Alfred, Sydney based biotech start-up GLIA Diagnostics, and the Adelaide-based CSIRO.
