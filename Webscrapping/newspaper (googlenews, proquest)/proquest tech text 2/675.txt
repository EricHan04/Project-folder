DOG owners could get a designated spot to “park” their pooch when shopping thanks to a bold initiative by a Melbourne couple.
Pet service start-up PetMinda is rolling out “dog pods” across Melbourne in a bid to provide a safe and comfortable spot for shoppers to leave their furry friends.
The pods are equipped with climate control, sterilisation technology and a live video feed in order to protect dogs from the elements and being harassed or breaking loose in the street.
Founders Blake and Sarah Horstman said the service was set up in response to rising dog theft statistics, which doubled in the first three months of the 2020 lockdown as demand and prices for pets soared.
“We know the anxiety that pet owners feel when they have to leave their dog outside the shops, even for a moment,” Mr Horstman said. “The pods provide owners a better option and the ability to combine walking their dog with their daily exercise and errands.” Pet pods start at $6 for the first 30 minutes of pooch-minding. After that, it costs 20c for every additional minute.
