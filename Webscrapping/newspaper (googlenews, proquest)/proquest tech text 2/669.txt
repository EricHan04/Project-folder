VISA changes are needed to attract space start-up companies to Australia to help grow the lucrative industry, the University of SA says.
New visa options for potential employers to come to Australia would help attract “high-potential space start-ups”, UniSA has told a parliamentary inquiry looking at how to develop Australia’s fledgling space sector.
“The current option, the Global Talent visa, is designed to support employees, not employers, and as such early stage founders who are not yet generating a salary ... are limited in how they can establish operations in Australia,” UniSA’s submission says.
“This situation inhibits the ability of the Australian space industry to grow the space sector.” Southern Launch, which is developing rocket launch facilities on Eyre Peninsula, called for the Federal Government to consider financial incentives for skilled migrants with expertise in the space sector to relocate to Australia.
“For Australia’s space industry to grow and remain internationally competitive, it must attract experienced skills and experts from overseas markets,” the company’s submission says.
Southern Launch recommended Australia axe fees for rocket launch permit applications, saying they made the country uncompetitive. The South Australian Space Industry Centre told the inquiry states needed to work together to “optimise scarce resources” as unfettered competition “has the potential to destroy the industry in its infancy”. The government agency said Australia needed to grow its sovereign manufacturing capability so it could be part of global supply chains.
