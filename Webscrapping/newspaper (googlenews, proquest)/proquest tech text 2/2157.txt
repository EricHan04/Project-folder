From Page 1 Mr Rattenbury said Tesla's 100-megawatt battery in South Australia - promoted as the largest of its kind in the world - had shown energy storage technology had a range of benefits.
"It doesn't just provide power during blackouts and alike, or potential blackouts, but also a range of ancillary services around stabilising the grid," he said.
Mr Rattenbury expected the successful bidder would be selected early next year, with contracts to be signed by mid-2020.
He said based on government modelling, the extra 200-250 megawatts to be delivered through the latest auction would shore up Canberra's electricity supply until the "middle to later part of the next decade".
The need for further auctions would be determined by the demand for electricity as the city's population grew.
News of the new auction comes as the ACT government prepares to unveil its new climate action strategy in the coming days.
The strategy will outline how the government will help drive the "decarbonisation" of the Canberra region up to 2025 and beyond, Mr Rattenbury said.
He said the timing of the two announcements was coincidental, though he acknowledged they both progressed the ACT's vision for a low-emissions future.
"We have a legislated target to reduce our emissions by 50-60 per cent by 2025 and a key part of that is electrifying because transport and gas will be our two biggest sources of emissions," Mr Rattenbury said.
