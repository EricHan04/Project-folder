FORMER Adelaide radio star Steve Bedwell has started a crowd-funding page seeking assistance in his debilitating battle with early onset dementia.
Bedwell revealed the diagnosis last year and has been receiving ongoing treatment, which he says makes it difficult to hold down regular work.
The former SAFM presenter spent almost three years in Adelaide before moving to Triple M in Melbourne. He said he wants to get back on his feet.
“There comes a time when things get to the point that you have to be pragmatic and you have to lower your pride a bit and try to live and get by,’’ he said.
“I’m fighting something I can’t see, that’s the problem. Many people face these things every day, but it’s hard when your brain starts to go and that’s fundamentally your tool. I’d like to think that science will help, I’m on several experimental medications which cost a bomb and I need to be around for my girls (aged nine and 14).” On the GoFundMe page titled “Bedders Needs Help”, he wrote: “I am also suffering from early onset dementia which has taken a terrible toll on my memory and rendered my capacity to perform neglieable (sic).
