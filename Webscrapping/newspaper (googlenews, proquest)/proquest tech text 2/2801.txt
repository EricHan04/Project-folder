Deep Data Analytics chief executive Mathan Somasundaram said expectations of inflation in the US were affecting shares.
"Look at what bonds are doing," he said.
"We are getting reflation in the US. That's driving the bond market to take profits."
Reflation is the stimulating of the economy, which governments in the US and Australia, as well as elsewhere, have done soon after the pandemic began.
Mr Somasundaram noted Australian bond yields jumped 10 basis points in the two days after the Reserve Bank decisions on Tuesday.
"That's a decent move, and that's telling you inflation is coming," he said.
"When the cost of borrowing rises, the market has to pull back."
