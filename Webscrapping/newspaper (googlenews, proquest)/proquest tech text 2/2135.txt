A company has won landowner approval to build a rocket launch facility on the southern tip of South Australia's Eyre Peninsula.
A space industry company has finalised landowner approvals, putting it one step closer to building South Australia's first rocket launchpads on the tip of Eyre Peninsula.
Southern Launch says it has the go-ahead from the landowners for the construction of two launchpads at its Whalers Way Orbital Launch Complex.
However, the company says it is still working through the approval process with the state and federal governments.
Once completed, the complex will allow the company to offer launch facilities to both Australian and international organisations and companies.
"With the advancement in satellite technology, more and more operators of small satellites are preferring dedicated launches," Southern Launch said in a statement on Wednesday.
"Operators are wanting to avoid constraints and delays of the other payloads on the same vehicle."
The Whalers Way site stretches over six kilometres of ocean frontage with more than 3000 kilometres of open ocean to the south. 
The company said the site was selected to maximise safety to people and the environment, with no rockets needing to overfly delicate marine environments or populated areas.
It also allows direct access to polar and sun-synchronous orbits.
Southern Launch said the new facility and its operational activities would be of significant benefit to the Eyre Peninsula community, the local economy and Australia more broadly, and would establish South Australia as a leading contributor to the global space economy.
