Annette Davey feels safer at work than anywhere else, thanks to strict Covid-safe measures in her workplace.
She was employed as a learning ambassador at Sydney’s Amazon Fulfilment Centre for three years before moving into a full-time Covid-19 marshall role with the online retail giant late last year.
Since the start of the pandemic, Amazon has implemented a 2m social distancing policy, with artificial intelligence technology used to indicate whether workers are maintaining a safe distance from one another.
Thermal screening at the centre’s entrance checks the temperature of workers and there are also strict mask protocols.
Posters throughout the building remind workers of Covid protocols, while two weeks of paid annual leave is provided to staff diagnosed with Covid or required to isolate.
“I can honestly say I feel safer at work than I do sometimes outside of work,” Davey says.
“I’ve actually stopped going into the supermarkets and I buy my groceries online now and have them delivered as I’d noticed that there were many people not wearing a mask or keeping a social distance and this made me feel really nervous.
“It’s really important for me to feel that my health and wellbeing is being looked after at work so that I know that I can visit my elderly mum and also my friends safely. “I’m also conscious of keeping myself safe so that I can visit my grandkids, who live a few hours’ away from me, so it’s important that these visits are not interrupted by Covid.”
