AUSTRAIAN “unicorn” tech start-up Culture Amp has shrugged off a difficult 2020 and has resumed hiring, with chief executive Didier Elzinga declaring the company is in a “sweet spot” amid changing workplace conditions but isn’t ready to contemplate an IPO.
Culture Amp, which was most recently valued at $1bn, was last year forced to cut 8 per cent of its workforce, with COVID-19 providing a rare stumbling block for a company that was previously accustomed to rapid growth.
The company’s most recent financial results filed with the corporate regulator ASIC show that its losses grew for the year ending June 30, 2020, with the company posting a net loss of $33m, from a $27m loss a year earlier, but its revenue was up 64 per cent to $45m from $27m a year earlier. The company also reported $67m cash on hand, from $16m in 2019.
Founded in 2009, Culture Amp produces software for companies to ­collect and understand employee feedback and Mr Elzinga, formerly of Adelaide, said 2021 was proving a pivotal year for his tech outfit.
“The workplace is changing and things aren’t going backwards,” Mr Elzinga, pictured, said.
“There’s been a big change, with remotely distributed workforces, to a whole range of issues and conversations that we weren’t having before in the workplace.
“It’s not gonna be easy but we see a huge opportunity for us to be at the heart of helping companies navigate those questions and those challenges, as we pull the handbrake after last year. We’re looking at a year now where we can’t hire fast enough.” The company now has 3500 customers and has hired 90 people since the start of 2021, but management says it is in no rush to launch an IPO.
