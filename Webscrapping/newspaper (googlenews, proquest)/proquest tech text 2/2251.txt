SOLAR panels and Tesla batteries will be installed free in 3000 Housing SA homes in a $61m expansion of a State Government scheme.
About 80 jobs will be created during installation.
Tenants will not own the systems but will buy the electricity at 22 per cent less than the default price, the cheapest offer in the state.
Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive Ian Learmonth, pictured, said it showcased smart technology.
“Tenants are often locked out of the clean energy market because they are unable to install rooftop solar systems on rental properties,” he said. Energy and Mining Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said earlier stages of the sche-me had equipped 1100 homes.
