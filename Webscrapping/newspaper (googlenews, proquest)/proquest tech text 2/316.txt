A company ranked among the UK’s top-10 start-ups has just launched in Brisbane and promises to help the events industry rebound from COVID.
Headbox provides an online marketplace for event organisers to find the most suitable venue for just about any kind of function.
It’s ideally suited for corporates searching for an event space that may be under-utilised or simply not on their radar previously.
Clients can use the platform to plan, manage and track their get-together and even access 3D pictures to see if possible spots are suitable without the hassle of physically inspecting them.
The firm has several income streams, charging commission for functions booked through its site and also making money from the sale of software subscriptions.
Ali Lord, who grew up on a Queensland cattle station and just returned from a six-year stint in London, is heading up the private equity-backed Australia operation.
It kicked off in Sydney last month and she’s forecasting revenues of about $720,000 this calendar year. The goal is to generate five times that amount by year three.
Lord told City Beat she plans to open in Melbourne late this year and then expand into Perth and Adelaide in 2022.
Kicked off in 2015, HeadBox lists more than 12,000 spaces across the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and now Australia.
