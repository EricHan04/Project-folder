ABOUT 2400 SA households will save money on their hot water service through a $10m pilot project being partly funded by the state and federal governments.
The project aims to use smart meters to heat water in the middle of the day, soaking up excess solar power, instead of the traditional off-peak system that draws power in the middle of the night.
The State Government and federal agency ARENA will each contribute $2m to the project being run by Rheem under its Solahart brand.
“Hot water can act like a heat sponge by storing solar energy for later use, and we want consumers to enjoy lower prices by tapping into solar power to heat their water,” state Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan said. Australian Renewable Energy Agency chief executive Darren Miller said hot water heating was one of the biggest users of energy in households.
“While it was once most efficient to heat water at night, now low-cost surplus electricity is increasingly available during the middle of the day,” he said.
“We need a way to know when this surplus power is available, and smart technology to manage electricity consumption at times when it will be the lowest cost to consumers without any loss of amenity.” The project will test different incentives among varied socio-economic groups. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said it was important to store excess solar power “to stop it going to waste”.
