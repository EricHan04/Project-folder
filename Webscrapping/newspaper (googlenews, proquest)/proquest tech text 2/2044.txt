I am Mother [M] ** 1/2 Director Grant Sputore (feature debut) Starring Clara Rugaard, Rose Byrne, Hilary Swank No ifs, just ‘bots
Manufactured right here in Australia — the fair city of Adelaide, to be exact — I am Mother is a carefully stylised work of science fiction sure to attract a select legion of admirers right around the world.
The non-discriminating, far-reaching distribution footprint of Netflix will find the eyeballs, and some of the finest screen design work seen in an Australian feature film (especially those on a small budget) will keep them peepers wide open and watching.
That’s the good news on I am Mother.
The bad news? The movie’s plotting is so conventionally and flatly structured that muted indifference is the only feasible response. Especially once those striking looks lose their lustre.
The setting is a post-apocalyptic future where maternally-programmed androids such as Mother (voiced by Rose Byrne) are wired to raise humans from an embryonic state into adulthood.
Curiosity about what is left of the world outside her clinical-facility home puts a young woman known only as Daughter (Clara Rugaard) in a danger she cannot hope to recognise, let alone understand.
While a high level of intrigue descends during the first half of the movie — as themes of alienation, artificial intelligence and personal ethics are ably, if too painstakingly explored — much of it dissipates as the storytelling mechanics become unnecessarily regimented.
Not even the arrival of the mysterious Woman (Hilary Swank), seriously injured and eager to convey some clarity to Daughter about her sheltered existence, can rouse the film from a steady state of semi-slumber.I Am Mother is now showing on Netflix
