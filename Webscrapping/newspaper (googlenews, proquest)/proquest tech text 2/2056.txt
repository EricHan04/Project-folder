A new high-tech Kangaroo Island koala count using drones, infrared cameras and artificial intelligence will begin this week to better understand the remaining population following the summer bushfires.
The innovative technology will scan trees at night across unburned patches and known koala locations around western KI, to count the species based on their body heat signature.
Minister for Environment and Water David Speirs said before the bushfires about 50,000 koalas were estimated to live on Kangaroo Island, having grown from a population of 18 that were introduced to the island in the 1920s.
"Earlier this year it was estimated that around 5,000 to 10,000 koalas remain on Kangaroo Island and the new survey will now confirm the population number," Mr Speirs said.
"About 85 per cent of their habitat was bushfire-affected, including most of the blue gum plantations where many koalas lived.
"Using innovative technology such as drones and infrared cameras we will be able to undertake a new count which will allow us to better understand the remaining population density and distribution.
"This will help National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia to plan a way forward and ensure the sustainability of one of Australia's most iconic and much-loved animals on Kangaroo Island."
The new koala count is being done by researchers from Queensland University of Technology.
