FATHER of two Danny Hansen had to change doctors to find one who would order him a PSA test after his dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Tests showed the IT consultant’s PSA levels had risen from 2.5 in 2017 to 3.8 in 2021 and he was concerned when his doctors did not urge him to seek further testing.
“When I read about this technology that takes your family history and your test results and pumps it through an artificial intelligence engine and it does a matching against a database of 250,000 men, that sounded like an awesome idea to me and that’s why I signed up to it,” he said.
“They identified me as high risk and you know, put me through another series of tests to do the diagnosis,” Mr Hansen said.
Two months after his prostate cancer was detected in June, he had a radical prostatectomy.
“I was very lucky that it hadn’t spread anywhere else in my body,” he said. “Hopefully the prognosis from here is that I’m all clear of cancer now, it’s just a watching brief for a few years.”
