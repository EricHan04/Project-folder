TECHNOLOGY SOME big-name Australian investors have poured $10m into The Good Car Company, a second-hand car marketplace for electric vehicles.
The Good Car Company, based in Tasmania and Australia’s largest importer of second-hand EVs, is tackling what its co-founder Anthony Brose van Groenou describes as the two biggest barriers to local electric vehicle adoption – supply and affordability.
“We delivered Australia’s first community EV bulk buy in 2019 and every year we witness more and more people wanting to transition to EVs and the opportunities they unlock,” he said.
Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes’ philanthro-pic green energy fund Boundless has invested in The Good Car Company, alongside Canva co-founder and fellow richlister Cameron Adams. The investment will boost the number of affordable second-hand EVs the company imports into Australia by tenfold per year, from about 200 to 2000. The start-up is importing pre-owned and new EVs from the UK and Japan.
