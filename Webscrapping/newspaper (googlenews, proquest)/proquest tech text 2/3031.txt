Local filmmaker Biddy O’Loughlin will be organising a screening fundraiser for her film, “A Zombie took my Dingo” in the next few weeks.
The film, which is still a work in progress follows two brothers who are playing ‘spies’, only to discover that there friends have turned into zombies, thanks to a bad batch of crystal meth from Adelaide.
“I had the idea for a few years and kept trying to make it and just for fun, and had to cancel the shoot on several occasions because of the lack of cash, cast and crew,” Ms O’Loughlin said.
“Finally last year all the stars lined up and I funded it through crowd-funding because you can’t get funding for short films anymore.
“We shot in and around Alice Springs just north of the ‘Welcome to Alice’ sign and down to Ilparpa and in the streets and just around the alleyways of Eastside.
Ms O’Loughlin is hoping to premier the film in Sydney, or one of the major film festivals around Australia and the world, and is looking to raise funds by screening the final draft of her film, in order to put the finishing touches on the movie.
“The idea is to hire out a cinema, and basically invite a lot of cast and crew so they get to see the film.
“The reason I wanted to do it at the Alice Springs cinema was because the boys who were in the film asked if it was going to be a real movie at the cinema, and I said yes, so I want to deliver,” she said.
The fundraiser will go towards finishing the film and also putting in a film festival application.Locals are urged to keep an eye out for details when the fundraising event will occur.
