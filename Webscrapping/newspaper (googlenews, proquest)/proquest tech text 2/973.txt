FORMER Techstars Adelaide managing director Terry Gold has been appointed entrepreneur in residence by the University of South Australia to support local start-ups.
Mr Gold, pictured, will be the second entrepreneur in residence at the university’s Innovation & Collaboration Centre following the appointment of Kirk Drake in August last year.
Mr Gold moved to Adelaide from the US in 2016 to take up the role of growth entrepreneur in residence at the university’s Aust-ralian Centre for Business Growth.
A former US entrepreneur, Mr Gold said that starting a company could be a lonely business and hoped to help support early-stage founders.
“I was once a young entrepreneur myself and I know how much it helped to be able to talk to people with the experience of starting and growing a company,” he said.
“If I can play even a small role in the development of a vibrant start up ecosystem in South Australia, I will be delighted.” Mr Gold said the new focus on space and defence technologies showcased enormous potential for growth. “I’m keen to share the lessons I’ve learned – it might save a few people from making the same mistakes I made as a first-time entrepreneur,” he said.
ICC director Jasmine Vreugdenburg said Mr Gold was the perfect choice to join the ICC community.“Terry has already given so much of his time supporting founders in the ICC as well as other parts of the South Australian ecosystem during his time in Adelaide that it just made sense for us to acknowledge his contributions with this appointment,” she said.
