FORMER Adelaide Crows ruckman Brad Moran is celebrating a $205m payday following the sale of his Brisbane-based company CitrusAd.
The sale to French multinational advertising and public relations firm Publicis Groupe comes a decade after Mr Moran’s AFL career at the Crows was cut short by injury.
Mr Moran, 35, who’s now based in Brisbane, describes his forced retirement in 2011 as a “sliding doors” moment that kick-started a successful career in business.
“Would I have liked to play another 10 years, maybe, but I look back now and probably think it’s the best thing that’s happened,” Mr Moran (pictured) said.
CitrusAd is an online advertising platform that enables supermarkets and other retailers to charge brands a premium for the best product placements on their online stores.
Just like brands compete for eye-level product placements in physical stores, CitrusAd replicates that concept for online shopping.
Since it was launched by Mr Moran and Adelaide-based business partner Nick Paech in December 2017, CitrusAd has secured prominent customers including Woolworths, Coles and Dan Murphy’s in Australia, Tesco in the UK and Target in the US. CitrusAd will now form part of Publicis Groupe’s data analytics business, Epsilon, with Mr Moran and Mr Paech remaining as chief executive and chief marketing officer.
