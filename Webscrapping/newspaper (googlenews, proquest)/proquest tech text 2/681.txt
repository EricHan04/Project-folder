AN Adelaide start-up is bouncing back from a COVID-19 setback with plans to roll out hundreds of portable mobile phone chargers to pubs, hospitals, cafes and other hospitality venues in the new year.
Jumpstart has launched an equity crowdfunding campaign to raise the $300,000 needed to complete app development and acquire around 200 docking stations from its Chinese manufacturing partner.
Founded by last year’s SA Young Entrepreneur of the Year, Edward Juers, the company wants to build a shared network of portable phone chargers backed by the Jumpstart app.
Users requiring a top-up of their phone battery will be directed to the nearest Jumpstart Dock (J-Dock), where they can rent a charger at 99c per 15 minutes. They will then be able to return the charger to any participating venue.
Mr Juers said the company came close to securing $500,000 from investors in January, before they pulled out due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
“Before COVID hit we were working with groups like 7-Eleven and Healthscope and a couple of local pub groups and we were ready for a massive 2020,” he said.
“But then COVID hit and everything ground to a halt.
“What we’re trying to do with the Birchal (equity crowdfunding platform) capital raise is finish the app and take advantage of the opportunity that’s out there for this.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jumpstart rebranded and redesigned its charging units, and continued to investigate opportunities to grow nationally and internationally. It hopes to deploy 1000 J-Docks across Australia and New Zealand in the next two years. Expressions of interest in the capital raise close on Wednesday, ahead of a one-week private raise and then a public offer period.
