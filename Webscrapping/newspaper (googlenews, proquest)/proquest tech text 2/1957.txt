AUSTRALIAN adults want to see “life skills” introduced into school curriculums, including money management, job preparation and domestic tasks.
Research from Monash University shows that adults also widely support the inclusion of technology, coding and artificial intelligence subjects to student curriculums to prepare them for future jobs.
