SUPPORTERS of Keith and District Hospital will hold a public meeting on Monday as the threat to close services from tomorrow remains a chance.
The board is demanding more cash from the State Government for the private, not-for-profit community hospital backed by a threat to close services from tomorrow but Health and Wellbeing Minister Stephen Wade is refusing to add to the $400,000 granted in December on top of the normal $1 million a year, saying it would not be fair to other rural hospitals.Hospital supporters warn lives are at risk if its 24/7 emergency department closes and have started crowd funding, raising $2600 so far towards its $280,000 goal. The hospital has been paying locums to man the service.
