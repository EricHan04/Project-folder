START-UPS PRESCRIPTION drugs have become the latest items delivered via the gig economy as it matures from fulfilling late- night hamburger orders and ridesharing, to ensuring medication arrives at your doorstep, even at weekends.
Melbourne-based start-up Medmate is set to launch in its home city, with plans to expand to Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, after running a successful pilot and three years of planning.
The business – led by GP Ganesh Naidoo and pharmacist Wael Hanna – has partnered with food delivery giant DoorDash to perform 24/7 door-to-door deliveries of pharmaceuticals.
Dr Naidoo developed the concept after his mother and some of his patients experienced difficulties fulfilling their medication, with non-adherent rates as high as 50 per cent.
He said Medmate would make “fulfilling prescription medications as simple as ordering a meal from Uber Eats”, processing medications electronically within 60 minutes.
Dr Naidoo said there were several reasons for a patient not adhering to medications but the main one was logistics. “They simply find it too inconvenient, they forget and they run out,” he said. “We thought there was a (need for a) simpler way for people to access their medications when they need them.”
