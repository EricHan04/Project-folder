DAIWA TD BLACK MQ Combining Daiwa’s advanced Zaion V material with Monocoque body (MQ) design has resulted in a TD Black reel that is lighter, stronger and more precision designed than ever before.
The MQ uses larger gears for enhanced power, precision and longevity, with its single-piece construction increasing body strength and rigidity. The LT Concept combines with Tough Digigear for optimum reel power and refinement, while Zaion Air Rotor allows for flawless rotational balance and minimal start-up inertia. A Magsealed body provides excellent protection from the elements, and the ATD Drag delivers ultra-smooth stopping power and control. LT’s Long Cast ABS spool, machine cut handle, Airbail, and CRBB bearings complete the TD Black MQ’s extensive list of design features and technologies.
