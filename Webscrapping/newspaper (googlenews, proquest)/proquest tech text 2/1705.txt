IT is time for computers and machines to learn our language, rather than humans having to learn to speak “geek”.
And a $20m investment in establishing a new research centre at Adelaide University aims to help get us there.
“It’s always the humans that have to adapt,” Professor Anton van den Hengel said. “The interfaces to most advanced technology are horrible. Computers are incredibly powerful but we have to go to them and learn how to drive those complex bits of machinery. We want the computer to adapt and understand and implement human intent.” Prof Hengel, pictured, is the inaugural director of the Centre for Augmented Reasoning, a national initiative based at Adelaide University and funded in this week’s Federal Budget.
The funding will support postdoctoral research work, PhD scholarships and programs to apply the knowledge in the community.
“Augmented reasoning gives machines an ability to solve some of the current frustrations with computers and technology that everyone experiences,” Prof van den Hengel said.
“Machine learning is revolutionising every industry.
“It’s already changed transport and it is fundamentally changing mining and agriculture. We want to enable machines to be able to discover new things in an ongoing partnership with humans, to understand our intent, and explain their actions.” The university’s interim vice-chancellor, Mike Brooks, said the centre would “cement South Australia’s position as the nation’s lead state for artificial intelligence research and innovation, and stimulate a new generation of hi-tech businesses and jobs here in the state”. Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said the centre would create jobs and improve Australians’ quality of life.
