Former Diamonds captain Liz Ellis has labelled Netball South Australia’s response to Maria Folau’s support of her husband’s crowdfunding campaign “not good enough” in a tweet that quickly went viral.
“There is no room for homophobia in our game. Anyone who is seen to support or endorse homophobia is not welcome. As much as I love watching ⁦Maria Folau play netball I do not want my sport endorsing the views of her husband,” Ellis said.
The tweet was shared more than 450 times, attracting almost 2000 likes in a few hours.
Earlier today, Netball SA issued a statement that said Folau had not breached her team’s social media policies by sharing her husband Israel’s controversial crowd funding campaign.
Netball SA chief executive Bronwyn Klei said that while the organisation, which owns the Adelaide Thunderbirds, in no way endorses Folau’s reposting, it did not break the team’s rules.
Klei stressed that her organisation is “fiercely determined to provide an inclusive environment” but that it also “believes in fairness and perspective”.
“Maria is a key member of the Thunderbirds,” Klei said.
“We continue to support her as we support all our players.” Netball Australia echoed that support in a separate statement.Israel Folau launched a crowdfunding campaign on Friday to support a legal fight against Rugby Australia.
