SO single-use plastics are being banned, thanks to the lefties. You watch, it will be like the plastic bags. You will have to pay 15c for a straw.

SO, single-use straws, cutlery and stirrers are going to be banned. Priorities people. I hope that means all the millions of tons of soft-drink bottles, milk bottles, shampoo bottles, supermarket meat packaging, etc, are all being fully recycled before we start worrying about drinking straws.

WELL done to Hong Kong and Singapore for banning flights from the UK bringing those who have made lots of money working over there. And now it’s got too hot over there, it’s time to rush back to safe Australia, bringing their germs with them.

THE majority of fish caught by British fishermen have been exported to the European Union. And the majority of fish consumed by people in Britain have been imported. Where’s the sense in that?
RIDICULOUS
IF I help myself to other people’s money, it’s called stealing and I can go to jail. But when people in councils do the same it seems they say they’re sorry and they get a slap on the wrist. How’s that fair?
