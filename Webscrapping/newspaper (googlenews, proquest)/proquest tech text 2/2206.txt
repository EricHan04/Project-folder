NEED TO KNOW!
HOW IT WORKS You’re a coach with a team to pick, a salary cap to work under and games to win. Select a squad of players from across the AFL and score points based on their real-life performances in AFL games, using a formula developed by Champion Data. Take on your mates in your own private league for ultimate bragging rights, and track your progress against all other SuperCoaches in the race for weekly and major prizes.
HOW TO PLAY Once you’ve registered for KFC SuperCoach AFL: YOU have a $10m salary cap and 30 players to pick.
FILL each position. You need eight defenders, 11 midfielders, eight forwards, and three rucks.
YOU will need a mix of reliable stars, bottom-priced players who will rise in value and a few players in between. Look for players who are underpriced due to injury or a change in role.
NEED help picking a side? Try the auto select feature which picks a team for you instantly and then make all the changes you want.
CHANGE your team as much as you like until round 1 starts on March 16. BEFORE each round, choose a starting 22 and nominate one of your bench players in every position as an emergency.
NOMINATE a captain who earns double points, and a vice-captain as back-up. YOU get 35 trades to maintain your side during the season. Each week you can make up to two trades, except for the bye rounds when you get three trades.
HOW PLAYERS SCORE POINTS Players score points based on a formula devised by Champion Data to reward actions that have the biggest impact on matches. For example, players who win a crucial one-on-one contest and hit a target when the game is on the line. There are also negative acts that cost players KFC SuperCoach points, such as turnovers and giving away free kicks and 50m penalties.
