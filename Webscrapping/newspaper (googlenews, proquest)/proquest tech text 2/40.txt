THIS week, News Corp South Australia and FutureADL are welcoming four new interns into the newsroom to explore just how innovative South Australian start-ups and businesses have become.
We are joined by Isabella Kelly, Ruby Stewart, George Jankovic and Eva Blandis, who are all current university students completing their degrees. This opportunity offers the chance to gain real-world experience and build contacts that will kick-start the students’ careers in journalism.
The interns will be based in both NewsCorp SA headquarters and the Stone & Chalk start-up hub, working across innovation districts Lot Fourteen and Tonsley, speaking to some of South Australia’s most creative thinkers and entrepreneurs in businesses across space, defence, hi-tech, cyber security and more.
Over the next four weeks, they will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in all-things media, including creating content for print and online mediums.
“It is super exciting to have emerging talent from our universities join the team and bring fresh new perspectives while gaining experience from some of our most experienced journalists as mentors,” News-Corp SA commercial editor Bret Fisher says.
“It’s about sharing knowledge to help support, encourage and develop the next generation of journalists.
“I really look forward to reading what they have to say about the exciting world of business and innovation happening here in SA from their perspective.” You will be able to read their stories over the coming weeks in The Advertiser and online at advertiser.com.au/futureadelaide.
