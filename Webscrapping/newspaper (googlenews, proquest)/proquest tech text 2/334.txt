ADELAIDE is fast emerging as one of the country’s tech and start-up powerhouses, according to the head of a new national industry group.
The Technology Council of Australia (TCA) expects a burgeoning pipeline of technology jobs to play a key role in the economic bounce-back from Covid-19.
The industry group was established in August to influence public policy, with the goal of boosting employment in the industry to one million people by 2025.
Its chief executive Kate Pounder, pictured, who is based in Canberra, grew up in regional South Australia but left Adelaide after graduating from university to pursue a career in the technology sector.
Two decades later, she said Adelaide is emerging from Covid-19 as one of the country’s leading centres for technology companies and start-ups, backed by a supportive state government, a deep talent pool and an attractive and affordable lifestyle.
“I left Adelaide because at that time if you were interested in the tech sector and tech policy there wasn’t a lot of opportunity in Adelaide, so I’m really excited to see the way the industry’s grown there and the great work that the state government’s doing, and that the unis are doing,” she said.
“I think it means for that next generation of people coming forward, they’ve got the choice to stay now in Adelaide and pursue their career there.” A recent report by Accenture found the technology industry supports 33,000 jobs in SA and contributes $6bn annually to the economy.
Ms Pounder said the research also found Adelaide was one of the fastest growing regions in the country for employment in the sector. “This jobs boom shows the dividend states, such as South Australia, can get from positioning their state as a tech hub and actively working with tech employers to locate the business and jobs in the state,” she said.
