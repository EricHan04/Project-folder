SUPPORTERS of Keith and District Hospital have resorted to crowd-funding as the standoff with the State Government over cash continues.
The board of the private, not-for-profit community hospital has threatened to shut the emergency department from Sunday if it does not get a funding injection.
Health Minister Stephen Wade has baulked at more cash following a one-off $400,000 grant, on top of $1 million annual funding.
Mr Wade has made it clear the $400,000 was to get the hospital to the end of the financial year and says any more would not be fair to other country hospitals trying to operate within their budgets.
With time running out a GoFundMe page has been set up, aiming to raise $280,000. It raised more than $1000 within hours of going live.
Organisers of the page say lives are at risk if the 24/7 emergency department closes.
“The emergency department assists more than 500 patients every year,” the page says. “Several of these patients would simply not be alive if it were not for Keith Hospital’s emergency department.
“The hospital has been under huge financial pressure since June 2018, when it became necessary to pay for locum GPs to maintain existing services. With locums commonly costing $2000 per day, the hospital is now at risk of closing its emergency department if it does not receive funding urgently.”The hospital last year cut ties with Tristar Medical Group, which was contracted to provide two GPs for five days a week plus 24/7 on-call availability but was unable to do so. The hospital is paying locums but expects to have a permanent doctor starting in June.
