A strong flow of capital into dedicated pre-IPO funds will keep the initial public offers flowing this year, while private capital is also increasingly on the hunt for exposure to the transition to a low carbon economy, says John Kain, the managing director of mid-tier M&A firm Kain Lawyers.
Mr Kain, whose firm last year advised on deals including Archer Capital’s sale of V8 Supercars and Silk Laser’s $52m acquisition of Australian Skin Clinics, said the special purpose funds, which invested in private companies looking to list on the ASX in the short to medium term, had been growing in popularity.
While there have been players such as Regal Funds Management, Ellerston Capital and Bombora active in the sector for some time, other investors were now looking to the strategy for strong returns.
Alium Capital Management is an example that has been active in recent years, with its Alpha Fund focused on pre-IPO investments in ASX technology aspirants, as well as recapitalisations and placements.
Perennial also got involved in the sector three years ago, and in August closed its third private-to-public fund, which raised $200m in funds to deploy.
Microequities Asset Management in August launched its Private to Beyond the IPO Fund, which is targeting 15-25 per cent returns. That fund invested $5m in Adelaide artificial intelligence company Complexica last year.
