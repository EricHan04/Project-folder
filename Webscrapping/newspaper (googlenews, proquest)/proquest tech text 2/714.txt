ITALY: Joe Dombrowski won the fourth stage of the Giro d’Italia on Wednesday as ­Israel Start-Up Nation rider Alessandro De Marchi took the overall leader’s pink jersey after finishing just behind the American in second.
UAE Team Emirates’ Dombrowski was 13 seconds ahead of Italian De Marchi to claim the first Grand Tour win of his career on a soaking wet, 187km run between Piacenza and Sestola in the Apennine mountains.
Dombrowski, 29, won his first race in Europe on the toughest day of the Giro so far.
He dropped De Marchi, who was also part of a breakaway group of 25 riders formed after 40km, on the hardest slopes of the final Colle Passerino climb 5km from the finish.
“It wasn’t enough for the pink jersey but I think the stage win is a nice way to finish the day,” Dombrowski said.
“When you have a group of 25 riders, it’s never everyone co-operating, so you need to be ready for attacks. I knew De Marchi was maybe the strongest rider in the breakaway, so if I always took his wheel, I would be in a good spot.” De Marchi, 34, wears the pink jersey and sits 22 seconds ahead of Dombrowski in the overall standings.
“The goal was the pink jersey. I started thinking about it maybe two days ago even if I didn’t tell anyone,” De Marchi said. “I’m lost for words really. It’s the dream for any cyclist, especially if you are Italian.” A small group tipped to perform well in this year’s Giro, including 2019 Tour de France winner Egan Bernal, finished 1min 37sec down. But Bernal gained nine seconds on general classification contenders. Australia’s Jai Hindley moved to 27th overall but lost 34 seconds on Bernal.
