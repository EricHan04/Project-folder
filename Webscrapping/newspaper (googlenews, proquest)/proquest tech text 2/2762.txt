ONE of the schools at the centre of the rezoning furore has launched a multimillion-dollar science centre and a partnership with UniSA’s health sciences division.
Students are livestreaming lectures by UniSA experts and learning in a special data analytics room in the $3.5 million centre at Plympton International College, funded under the former Labor government’s STEM Works program.
The likes of science communicator Dr Karl Kruszelnicki and even Ethiopian water filtration experts are soon to be beamed live into the classroom, along with UniSA doctoral students working in the field around the world.
Students will also have access to UniSA’s own hi-tech laboratories. The school ultimately aims for the partnership to lead to students gaining uni credits while at school and direct entry to UniSA degrees, making for a seamless transition to higher education.
It is also planning industry partnerships aimed at having employers take on students straight out of school.
In the data analytics room, students can display their work and collaborate via a series of giant screens, and sessions can also be recorded.
“You can cycle through the group so everyone’s accountable for their learning and can share their perspective,” STEM co-ordinator Andrew Charlton said. Year 12 David Kuhn, 18, said: “You can be anywhere in the room and see what each other’s doing.” Plympton has also launched a 3D gaming and animation course in its “innovation studio”.
Families angry at being cut from the city high school zone have been zoned to Plympton, Underdale High and Springbank Secondary.Plympton principal Linda Richardson said her message to prospective parents was: “Come and see our fabulous school, our facilities ready for global learning.”
