EXXONMOBIL plans to develop a major carbon capture and storage project offshore in Victoria’s Gippsland Basin, in the latest push by the oil and gas industry to boost its green credentials.
The US energy giant is undertaking early engineering and design studies for a potential facility that can capture 2 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide with start up expected in 2025.
The scheme would use existing infrastructure to store carbon in the depleted Bream field off the coast of Victoria’s Gippsland Basin where Exxon already owns and operates a string of major oil and gas projects. Exxon said it was in discussions with local industries interested in accessing the hub, known as the South East Australian carbon capture and storage facility.
