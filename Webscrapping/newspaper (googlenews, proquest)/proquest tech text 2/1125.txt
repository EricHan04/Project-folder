A NEW artificial intelligence-based price assessment tool has launched on Punters.com.au.
Punters Edge, which is available exclusively for Punters+ members, uses 160 different data points to rate each horse’s winning prospects in a race.
On its first day this week, the tool successfully tipped six of eight winners at Tamworth.
The Punters Edge tool prices up each horse to determine if there’s a value edge against the market.
The algorithm processes the form of every horse in every race in Australia, weighting each factor according to its importance based on years of historical results.
The Punters Price is dynamic and updates to reflect these changes right up until race time.
It is then compared with the best available odds to determine where the value edge lies. In one glance, you can see the unders and overs on every race in the country.
