PETRA Starke, you might as well extend your question about reality TV to many other concepts that define today (“In a nebulous world, we’ve finally lost our grip on reality”, Sunday Mail, 8/12/19).
Social media is far from social. It is people abusing others without censure, causing eating disorders, suicide and whatever. Lies, damn lies and fake news dominate the lives of many a social-media fanatic. And let’s not forget the compulsive “fear of missing out”, or FOMO, as it’s known.
Then there’s artificial intelligence, which is nothing like an intelligent being. It’s just a bunch of programs written by humans, run by humans, using data that describes the past.
Programmers make mistakes and data contains bias and can be incomplete or inaccurate.
Autonomous vehicles will save the world from motor accidents. On this, I refer you to the comments above on AI and it’s decision-making capabilities.
Then there’s the cost of the changes needed to the transport infrastructure, which are likely to be prohibitive for most governments.
Electric vehicles will save the environment, only if we can double our current output of all forms of electricity generation.
And so it goes.
Currently, people’s expectations far exceed reality on so many levels.PETER GATCUM Encounter Bay
