THERE was an event held in Dubai last week called the World Government Summit which was attended by Belarussian inventor and engineer Anatoly Yunitskiy.
He is the brains behind the SkyWay concept, which was proposed as a transport solution for Adelaide’s streets. Think autonomous trams in the air, travelling at 150km/h.
The SkyWay concept was given credence in Adelaide because it was backed by the well-regarded former Transport Department chief Rod Hook. But after a couple of years of spruiking, the idea died in August when Hook conceded Yunitskiy had taken the concept to the United Arab Emirates. But it’s possible it was a lucky escape for Hook.
So far Belgium, New Zealand, Lithuania and Estonia have issued warnings to potential investors not to get involved with SkyWay. “The scheme proposed by SkyWay Capital exhibits the characteristics of a pyramid scheme,’’ Belgium’s Financial Services Markets Authority said in a statement.
SkyWay’s website is an interesting read. Like many too-good-to-be-true investments it offers remarkable returns.
“Increase your investments up to 1000 per cent or more in 3-5 years,’’ it says. SkyWay also claims to have $400 billion in pre-order contracts. An email to SkyWay asking it to detail the contracts went unanswered. Initially, punters are asked to stump up money in a crowd-funding exercise. The promise is the initial investment will become shares when SkyWay lists on the London Stock Exchange.Hook told Off the Record he had lost no money and didn’t believe it was a pyramid scheme. He also believed the engineering was sound, although he thought Yunitsky lacked “commercial sense’’.
