Instead, the Crows’ women’s coach and former Adelaide, Brisbane and St Kilda ruckman says the true trailblazers will be those who receive the accolade for their achievements solely in AFLW.

“To be held up as a pioneer for women’s footy (after the life membership) is true in some ways but it’s conflicting,” said Clarke, who steered Adelaide to an AFLW flag in 2019.
“It’s a tough spot because you want to help and think you can help but I’m conscious that you want to create opportunities for female coaches.
“There’s Peta (Searle) at the Saints and Michelle Cowan in Perth, and we obviously had Bec (Goddard) as the inaugural coach here, but they’re under-represented.”
“My situation is a bit different because I had a fairly long involvement in the men’s program but … because there’s so few games in each (AFLW) season we’ll have some 10 and 12-year veterans who have probably played just over 100 games.”
Clarke, who lined up in 258 games from 1993-2007, as well as four State of Origin clashes and 25 pre-season matches, was honoured but surprised when he learnt of his life membership because he did not think AFLW totals counted.
“It’ll be an interesting process as we get further along with players and coaches that are solely involved with AFLW, but it’s great to be having those conversations because it indicates it’s starting to embed and become part of the norm,” he said.
“Hopefully in the not-too-distant future the seasons are getting closer to a normal (men’s) length and … there might just be a special category for these pioneers in the first eight to 10 years.”
Clarke, 47, was starting to work as a veterinarian after his playing days ended when an opportunity to be the Crows’ part-time ruck coach emerged.
He did that for three years before taking it on full-time.
Ahead of the 2019 season, he grabbed the chance to juggle his men’s role with the AFLW position.
“What I’m happy to be involved with is this really quick integration from AFLW being a bit of a novelty initially to it … becoming part of the fabric of the club within a really short space of time,” he said.
“To see the joy it’s brought so many people, not just the players but those watching the game, has been great.
“And ultimately the girls have made our club significantly better, which brings with it a level of responsibility for me.”
Secret notes: What Cats great recorded over 13 years
- Rebecca Williams
Not long after he was drafted from East Fremantle to Geelong in the 2007 national draft, Harry Taylor wrote down some goals.
Taylor’s early ambition was to play 150 AFL games with the Cats, so he could secure a life membership with the club.
“I have always been very process driven and goal-orientated and I wrote down some goals not long after I got drafted,” the recently-retired defender said.
“I wanted to play 150 games because that would allow me to become a life member of our footy club.
“At the time, 150 games was our life member number. I wasn’t a life member of anything at that age and I knew people who were and I always saw that as a real sense of achievement, a real sense of hard work and loyalty all coming together.
“I remember putting that goal down and very fortunate to have played a few more games than that and had some success along the way.”
Fast forward more than 13 years and Taylor not only achieved his goal, he almost doubled it.
Securing not only life membership at the Cats, the champion backman was this week named among 12 new AFL life members to be inducted in March for their services to the game.
Taylor called time on his career after the grand final loss to Richmond last year following a career which spanned 280 games and delivered two premierships (2009 and 2011) and two All-Australian jackets (2010 and 2013).
He kept a meticulous record of all the key moments of his career in 13 years’ worth of journal entries in a collection of 20-odd diaries.
“I have got 13 years of books with different stories, different notes and things that I have been doing a bit of reflecting on,” Taylor said.
“They are not the flashest looking things, all handwritten so old school as in the school books that you might remember when you were in primary school.
“I am always constantly referencing different things in there, trying to find little motivations and reflecting on how I did things once, or how I played on a certain player before.
“Certainly, since I’ve finished I have been referencing them a lot more.
“I remember one of the significant pieces I wrote before my first game – we played Essendon of Round 2, 2008 – it was my first game of AFL footy and I wrote the night before how I was feeling and what things I needed to focus on.
“I wrote another one a couple of days before my last game which was Grand Final 2020 and what is really significant to me is that things I was focusing on way back in my first game I basically wrote down the exact same things 13 years later that I was still focusing on.
“I hadn’t read the first piece then copied it, it was basically just a reflection of my mindset at two different times in my career – 13 years apart, 280 games apart, but the commitment to a purpose and real clear values was exactly the same with everything that had happened in between. I guess that is something that I find satisfying and something that I am really proud of.”
Taylor’s two premierships with the Cats were clear highlights, but he said he has had just as much enjoyment reflecting on the “little moments” which made his AFL journey memorable among his many diary entries.
The 34-year-old has moved back to Western Australia since his retirement and has signed to play with his junior club Northampton in the Great Northern Football League this year.
“I started my football journey a bit later than most coming in at 21 and to be able to play 300 total AFL games is something that I’m very proud of,” Taylor said.
“I’m going to go back to where it all started and just try to help out and play a few games if I can.”
