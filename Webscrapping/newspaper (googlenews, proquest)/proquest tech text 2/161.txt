RESOURCES PERTH exploration start-up H2EX is tapping into the research expertise of the national science agency as it steps up its bid to unearth “gold” hydrogen in South Australia.
The company has entered into a research agreement with the CSIRO in the search for naturally occurring hydrogen, after recently securing its first exploration licence on the Eyre Peninsula.
H2EX said the CSIRO would undertake a “desktop study” of the licence area – covering close to 6000sq m – as a first step towards understanding the natural hydrogen system in the region.
Historical drilling records indicate that hydrogen at up to 85 per cent purity could be tapped in the region.
The potential for natural or “gold” hydrogen in Australia was underlined in a research paper published by the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia last year, which documents accidental discoveries of hydrogen across the country. Co-founder and chief executive Mark Hanna said H2EX was “one of the first companies in the world to explore for natural hydrogen”.
