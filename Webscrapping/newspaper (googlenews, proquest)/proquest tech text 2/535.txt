A plant analysis tool created by Bitwise Agronomy, has been judged the winner by audience members at the Pitch to Farmers competition during the AdvanceAg conference on Monday.
There were just under 30 agtech start-up finalists who registered their interest in the competition with 10 selected to present to a panel of judges in July then five finalists were picked to pitch their ideas to the audience.
Bitwise Agronomy co-founder Fiona Turner, Tas, created a platform that works collaboratively with GoPro technology, providing growers with actual count images and analysis tools to guide crop management decisions.
She was determined to keep investments in agtech locally and said the $10,000 prize money would allow Bitwise to hire an intern agronomist in SA to help growers take up the technology in the field.
"It's super exciting for us to win and events like this validates what we are doing," she said. "I would like to thank our existing users who are assisting us to collaborate data ... without those people, we would not have a great product.
"We hope to make an impact to assist driving down costs, help with climate change and supplying a durable product that will last for many years."
Ms Turner felt she was in a good position to create an agtech solution after experiencing the pain of owning a vineyard that was out of control.
"A lot of growers are making really critical business decisions about the health of the crop, deployment of labour and management of the crop, based on 10 plants per hectare, where typically growers have over 10,000 plants per ha," she said.
The shortlisted finalists who also presented their agtech solutions included, Winely, by Abby Hyde; Farmbot Monitoring Solutions by Andrew Coppin; Woven Optics Australia by Vicky Staikopolous; and Onside Pty Ltd, by Guy Davidson.
