BIOTECH firm Anteo­Tech will roll out its rapid COVID-19 test in Europe over the next few months, joining another Queensland start-up Ellume in the fight against the pandemic.
ASX-listed AnteoTech said yesterday it had received CE mark registration for the test that can detect the virus within 15 minutes and process up to 60 patients an hour.
AnteoTech said it had manufacturing facilities in Spain ready to start making the testing kits from later this month as borders open up across Europe. AnteoTech is one of the first Australian companies to receive European regulatory approval for a rapid COVID-19 test, allowing it to immediately enter the market of 447 million people.
CE marking indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area and the UK.
AnteoTech’s technology, which detects the virus using a molecular surface coating “glue”, is already used in Ellume’s test which recently received US Federal Drug Administration approval to roll out in the world’s biggest economy. Brisbane-based Ellume won a $US235m contract with the US Department of Defence in February for the manufacture and distribution of its rapid COVID-19 test.
AnteoTech chief executive Derek Thomson said the approval was a key milestone in the company’s strategy to build a global market for its products. “We believe we have a superior test with high sensitivity,” Mr Thomson, pictured, said.
