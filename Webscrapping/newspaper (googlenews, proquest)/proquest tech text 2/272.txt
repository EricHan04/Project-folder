Fleet Space Technologies says it wants to massively scale up nano-satellite manufacturing in Australia, as it prepares to put its fifth asset into orbit on Tuesday.
The Adelaide-based company has pitched for a $5m federal government Modern Manufacturing Initiative (MMI) grant.
It says that along with $4m it is raising itself and SA government support, the MMI would help it quadruple staff from 31 to 128 by 2024.
Chief executive Flavia Tata Nardini said key satellite components were currently only available overseas.
“Our manufacturing rate is very low,” she said.
“Australia lacks many of the manufacturing capabilities its industry needs to build satellite payloads and the satellites themselves. And we certainly can’t produce them in volume.
“We want to establish these manufacturing capabilities here in Adelaide so that we can kickstart Australia’s space industry.” Fleet expects to have a fifth satellite in space following a launch in New Zealand on Tuesday. It will be followed by another two scheduled for launch this year and 16 in 2022-23.
But Ms Tata Nardini said components such as complex printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) currently had to come from overseas, which was a constraint, but also an opportunity. Fleet Space said it needed to be able to design and prototype complex PCBAs up to 26 layers deep, but the best that Australian firms could do at present was 12 layers.
