THE American company behind the Playboy brand has announced a $439m buyout of a risque Australian lingerie label.
Playboy’s parent company, PLBY Group, Inc., overnight announced it had entered into a “definitive agreement” to acquire Honey Birdette, which began in Brisbane 15 years ago and now has 60 boutiques in three countries.
“The US company has signed a definitive agreement to acquire 100 per cent of the equity of Honey Birdette for a purchase price of approximately $439m ($US333m) in cash and stock,” the company said.
The lingerie stores were established in 2006 by Eloise Monaghan (pictured), who is also the creative director.
Honey Birdette is known for its daring ads and pushing the boundaries of censorship.
In 2017, Myer Centre Adelaide fielded complaints regarding Honey Birdette posters in its Rundle Mall. The advertising watchdog banned its in-store advertising because it was of a “highly sexual nature”.
Ms Monaghan said she was extremely proud that her Brisbane start-up business had been acquired by PLBY Group. “Today is a momentous and proud day for the Honey Birdette team as we enter into partnership with one of the world’s most iconic brands,” she said.
