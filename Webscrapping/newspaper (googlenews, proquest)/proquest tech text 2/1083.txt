A former Caritas College student has been awarded a scholarship through Playford Trust that will help pave his way through an engineering degree at university.
Joshua Graham, who was the Caritas school captain in 2020, has been awarded the Chartwells / St Ann's College / Playford Trust Residential Scholarship to support his engineering studies at the University of Adelaide and his residency at St Ann's College.
Mr Graham said it was really awesome and amazing to get the scholarship.
"You like to have that support from people who are so experienced in the industry and have such awesome connections," he said.
"It's definitely going to help pay for uni and I'm going to St Ann's College, it's going to help pay for that moving forward.
"They definitely help me with what I'm studying and keep me motivated."
He is currently studying electrical and electronic engineering, but originally began with space science.
He said he will be looking to break into the South Australian space industry as a satellite engineer after he has graduated and is currently planning to remain in Adelaide for work.
Mr Graham was one of 40 students to receive a scholarship from Playford Trust, which includes a share of around $600,000 in funding.
Playford Trust chair Dean Brown said the talent of the awarded students is remarkable across a diverse range of study areas.
"They're working in everything from lasers, photonics and renewable energy to bushfire risk, artificial intelligence and traffic management technologies," he said.
Playford Trust said scholarships were awarded in academic areas considered to be "of strategic importance" to South Australia.
