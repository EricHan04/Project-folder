A new fibre mill will service the Australian alpaca industry, giving a much-needed commercial scale onshore processing option to breeders.
Alpaca breeders Raelene and Brian Donovan have a farm at Wivenhoe Pocket, Qld, and were inspired to start up a mill by their own difficulties figuring out how to make a reasonable profit from their fleeces.
Mr Donavan said the major existing market was China, but the demand was not there for their coloured fleece.
"What we found then is the only options that were available were small mini mills and when you amass 300 kilograms, they'll either give you $5/kg if you're lucky for it ... or the price to get it turned to yarn starts to be about $300,000 when you get that sort of quantity," he said.
"Our original focus was to focus at the knitted end because that's where the money is.
"You don't get any money for the fleece. Yarn gets the money but you get more money for the knitted stuff so I ended up with a computerised knitting machine and a rugmaker that makes carpet."
Mr Donovan said the next problem was sourcing yarn to created the knitted items, so they decided to process their own through the Pocket Farm fibre mill, which has begun buying fleeces.
As well as processing raw fleece into yarn, the mill will also be able to make retail products, such as knitwear and scarves, to be returned to breeders, who can then sell them to add value to their businesses.
Mr Donavan said the capacity of their mill would be about 8 tonnes to 10t, based on the equipment installed so far.
The mill will start processing on a subcontract basis from April and, while focused on alpaca wool, will also deal with Angora, cashmere and Merino wool.
"We expect to have a big push in the next month to get everything up and running by the end of December, iron the bugs in the new year and then say we're accepting fleece to send back to people as yarn or whatever else they want," Mr Donovan said.
