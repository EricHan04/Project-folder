THESE five young South Australians are a picture of perfection in a COVID-marred year that was anything but perfect.
Giovanni Elias, Oliver Kleinig, Shreyans Sinhal, Paras Stefanopoulos and Martina Theodorakos were the only Year 12s to achieve the SACE Board’s definition of a perfect result – Merits in at least five subjects including the research project.
“These five remarkable students achieved the pinnacle of academic achievement,” SACE Board chief executive Martin Westwell said.
Their Australian Tertiary Admission Rank scores were either 99.9 or the highest possible 99.95. Giovanni, 18, from Rostrevor College, said he had to be flexible because of pandemic disruptions and disciplined to fit in soccer for Modbury Jets and a social life. He allocated tight blocks of time for study.
“When you limit yourself to a certain amount of time you get done what you need to do rather than procrastinating,” the aspiring doctor said. Oliver, 17, of St Peter’s College, was a house captain and had to meet the challenge of motivating others when they couldn’t physically meet because of COVID. He played water polo, ran cross country and did debating.
His St Peter’s classmate Shreyans, 18, felt lucky to be in SA where restrictions hadn’t been too bad. “And our teachers really helped out, they set up Zoom immediately and held extra sessions,” he said. Both Saints students want to study medicine.
Paras, 18, from St Michael’s College, does computer programming as a hobby, which dovetailed with his subject mix and research project into artificial intelligence. He aims to study advanced computer science at uni. Martina, 18, from Walford, wants to study law and advanced economics either in Adelaide or Sydney.
Martina worked at a bakery and found time for family and friends. “I wasn’t cooped up in my room,” she said. “I want to make changes in a lot of areas where females aren’t well represented.”
