BAROSSA and Tamborin operator Santos is on track to proceed with its Moomba carbon capture and storage project this year which could potentially bring economic spin-offs to the Northern Territory.
Final Investment Decision on the $165m carbon reduction project was announced in November and Santos says the plant will have its first injections in 2024. About 770km north of Adelaide in the South Australian Outback, Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher said the project footprint, when completed, could include CCS offshore plants in WA and Bayu Undan north of Darwin. Santos is also working with the East Timorese government to forge an agreement to use the soon-to-be-depleted Bayu-Undan LNG backfill project for CCS.
About 250km southeast of Suai in East Timor and 500km northwest of Darwin, Mr Gallagher said if developed, the three-hub strategy would provide carbon capture and storage of more than 30 million tonnes a year or 10 million tonnes at each of its facilities. “Moomba will be first projected to hit the go button but I am especially excited about the potential we have to repurpose Bayu Undan as a ccs hub for the region,” he said.
“We estimate a storage capacity of around 10 million tonnes of CO2 per annum once production from the field ceases. Our studies indicate existing wells and pipeline can be repurposed for CO2 service.
“By project start-up over 1bcf of gas a day was injected into these high permeability reservoirs so they are some of the best offshore reservoirs in the region for gas injection. “Bayu Undan ccs could contribute to decarbonising Barossa from project start-up as well as opening up other resource opportunities in Northern Australia.”
