1 MAHAMEDEIS (2) looks the horse to beat. He is hard fit and loves the distance. Flashed late to grab third in the Group 3 Easter Cup behind Hang Man and Persan, so on that alone he should be hard to beat. Cannot fault FANCIFUL TOFF (4), having won or run second in each of his past four starts. MOONLIGHT MAID (1) has obvious ability but her last win was October 2019. Market moves? DECLARES WAR (3) and BARRY THE BAPTIST (5) are the pick of the roughies. Declares War won three on the bounce before faltering in the Albury Cup. Three times a winner at 2000m. BET Mahamedeis win
2 SPRING CHOICE (8) gave Shandy a fright at big odds at Sandown Lakeside last start. Gets William Pike in the saddle and drawn perfectly to be in the finish. Listed winner as a three-year-old before two extended breaks. SOUTH PARADE (13) is a danger but is expected to be scratched due to the wide barrier. SOMERSET MAUGHAM (2) needs further to be a strong winning chance but on class alone has to be included. DICE ROLL (9) is one of the most interesting runners on the card. He is a Group 3 winner in France. Flopped in Hong Kong but stable confidence suggests forward showing. BET Dice Roll each-way 3 BEAU ROSSA (3) is chasing a hat-track after wins at Morphettville and a formidable seven-length Sandown Hillside romp last start for Will Clarken and Jamie Kah. This is harder but drawn perfectly and looks to have oodles of upside. RIPPER RITA (13) has been a model of consistency in five career starts, a win and three minor placings. She never got a clear run at them last start and should be in the finish again. MISS INBETWEEN (12) got the bob last start. Up in grade but gets conditions to suit. BLACK PENN (4) is open to improvement after being cluttered up in traffic last start. BET Beau Rossa win 4 MR QUICKIE (1) is the best horse in the race by some margin. Small fields tend to throw up some odd results but the popular swooper has the tactical speed to get out of trouble. Just wins, with even luck. SHANDY (8) has attracted good support and deservedly so, winner of three of her past five starts. Disappointed as favourite last start at Caulfield when caught on the wrong part of the track. SO SI BON (2) is always around the mark and especially at this level. The evergreen galloper will look the winner at some point. GALAXY RAIDER (6) caught the eye fresh running third. Include in any exotic 5 SHELBY COBRA (1) resumes after a five-month break but has the class to figure in the finish, despite a wide barrier. Stable harbours spring ambitions for the progressive sprinter, who should only improve with more racing. LA MEXICANA (2) finds another gear on rain-affected ground. Won three of her past five. BELLA NIPOTINA (5) is a model of consistency and deserves another win. CAPRICCIO (7) bobbed up at big odds to win last start, while FOREVER FREE (8) has the class to be in the finish despite failing at past two outings. BET La Mexicana win 6 STARRY LEGEND (2) has made good two-year-olds look average in his first two starts. Will be popular despite stepping to 1200m for the first time. If he settles in the run, he wins. ARCADED (10) is the testing material and a last-start Group 3 winner. SLIDERS (11) is the second Godolphin runner and she jumped out smartly before Victorian debut flop at Caulfield. Forgive. FINANCE TYCOON (1) has been racing against some of the best two-year-olds in the country for two wins and a second from five career starts. LITERARY MAGNATE (13) won her Warrnambool maiden on heavy ground.
7 ANCESTRY (1) showed his customary speed at Mornington but punctured over the final stages. Back to 1100m which should suit him better again. LYRE (3) is always around the mark but rarely wins out of turn. Gets her chance again after back-to-back seconds. RUBISAKI (7) has the talent to blow them away but failed to come up last preparation. Given a good break since and won a jumpout at Cranbourne recently. SISSTAR (9) and ALFA ORO (10) are class runners. Sisstar is shooting for three wins on the trot, while Alfa Oro could be Adelaide-bound with a good performance. BET Sisstar each-way 8 LAVERROD (1) broke through for a stylish win in the Listed Hareeba Stakes last start. Pike on again and the Toronado gelding has never missed the placings (8: 3-3-2) at 1200m. Looks the horse to beat again. HOW WOMANTIC (3) will be up on the speed and hard to run down. She finished behind Laverrod at Mornington last start. Respect. SAM’S IMAGE (5) was an impressive winner at Bendigo, when first-up after a long break. Struggled with feet issues previously but they’re a distant memory now. A definite each-way chance. PAUL’S REGRET (11) ran second to Probabeel at Caulfield only two starts back. BET Laverrod win 9 LUNAKORN (10) at her best could be winning. Forget she went around last start, never a factor in the Matron Stakes. Her form prior is strong enough to win but monitor conditions as she goes best on top of the ground. LA CHEVALEE (5) won first-up last preparation. Drawn out but with even luck should be in the finish. GOOD AND PROPER (14) has been in a rich vein of form, runner-up past two starts after back-to-back wins. Will get back from barrier four so could need favours in the straight. First emergency SHAHZADE (17) loves getting a toe in, and if they’re swooping will be a factor late. BET Lunakorn win
