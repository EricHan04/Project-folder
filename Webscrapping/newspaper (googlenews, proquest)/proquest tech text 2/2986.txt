THE Kangaroo Island bodies fighting accommodation plans in Flinders Chase National Park have launched a new campaign to raise another $50,000 towards their legal fees.
Public Parks, Not Private Playgrounds, which represent a range of local groups, launched the new crowd-funding bid yesterday, to add to the $48,000 it has already raised.
Groups including Kangaroo Island Eco Action and various Friends of Parks organisations want to block Australian Walking Company’s plans for accommodation at Sanderson Bay and Sandy Creek.The project, which has received approval from the State Commission Assessment Panel and Native Vegetation Council, would be used for walkers on the company’s luxury guided tours of the Kangaroo Island Wilderness Trail.
