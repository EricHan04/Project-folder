HIGH school students will soon be able to learn digital skills through a partnership between IBM and the state government.
Courses in blockchain, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other cyber sectors will be available free.
The six-month program will be offered to public, Catholic and independent schools, with students earning digital badges for completing the courses.
IBM Australia and New Zealand managing director Katrina Troughton said there was a national shortage of cyber security workers.
“Cyber security is one of the biggest issues of this decade,” Ms Troughton, pictured, said.
“With a shor­t­age of people with cyber skills in Australia, we need to look at ways to fast-track young people into these critical areas of need, and that challenge is bigger than any organisation to address alone.” The online courses have already been available free from IBM but the partnership brings in schools to support the students. There also will be face-to-face workshops in some schools. South Australia follows NSW where a similar partnership has attracted nearly 70 schools.
Innovation and Skills Minister David Pisoni said SA was in a prime position to build a cyber workforce and the program was aligned with identified needs of industry.
“The IBM SkillsBuild program will give high schools access to an amazing resource that is free for students and educators,” he said.
The partnership will include the SA Cyber Security Innovation Node, part of independent organisation AustCyber. The program complements the computer and cyber studies options of the Australian curriculum and SA Certificate of Education. “With an estimated 7000 new direct jobs needed in the cyber security sector by 2024, now is the time to give our students the skills they need to be ready to meet our future challenges,” AustCyber chief executive Michelle Price said.
