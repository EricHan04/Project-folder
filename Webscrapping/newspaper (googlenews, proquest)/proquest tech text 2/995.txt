HUB Adelaide has opened applications for its Spark Program – a one-year all-inclusive workspace and mentoring package designed to supercharge start-ups.
Supported by Renewal SA and Flinders University’s New Venture Institute, the program enters its third year in 2020 and accepts two intakes each year.
Participants receive $1000 to go towards their venture or further study, 12 months’ use of the Hub Adelaide co-working space and business promotion opportunities through Hub Australia’s national and international networks.
They will also receive a place in Flinders University’s eight-week pre-accelerator program Venture Dorm, which provides marketing, pitching and mentoring support.
Founder of education software start-up Skoolcraft, David Tucker, participated in the Spark program last year. He said it “opened a thousand” doors for his fledgling venture.
“I decided to apply for the Spark program, and it’s been amazing,” he said. “It started off as a dream, and through being in the Spark program it (Skoolcraft) has taken on a life of its own.” Other previous participants include entrepreneurs Alex Wallis, Scott Cabot, Emily Hanna and Josh O’Shaughnessy.
Applications for the Spark program close on February 14.FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT: HUBAUSTRALIA.COM/SPARK/
