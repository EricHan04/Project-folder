A BRIGHT idea to double donations to next year’s Adelaide Fringe is part of its new community partnership with Lumo Energy SA.
The energy retailer will match the first $10,000 raised today by the Fringe’s Invest in the Arts crowd-funding appeal.
Fringe director Heather Croall said the fund matching would go a long way toward helping artists, venues and audiences bounce back from COVID.
“Any donation, big or small, will be matched by Lumo Energy SA, and will be donated directly to the artist or venue of your choice,” Ms Croall said.
Lumo Energy SA marketing manager David Holman said the inclusivity, fun and celebration of the Fringe were qualities the brand valued. “We believe there’s never been a more important time to support the Adelaide Fringe,” he said. “COVID-19 has obviously presented many challenges, particularly for those in the performing arts and hospitality industries. Fringe is a great way for the community to get behind our homegrown talent while enjoying food and wine.” Performer Carla Anita Mattiazzo, from Fringe show The Catchelorette, said the partnership to double donations was “outstanding”.
“This year, as we all know, has been ridiculously devastating and Lumo making that effort will make so much of a difference to all the artists out there.” As community partner, Lumo will also assist the Fringe with e-ticketing to make the event more eco-friendly and COVID safe.
