WINE WINE brand Penfolds has burst into the brave new world of non-fungible tokens, launching a $US130,000 NFT related to its limited edition Magill Cellar 3 barrel.
The NFT, or digital token, will see the Penfolds Magill cellar barrel of wine, made from the 2021 vintage, permanently etched into the blockchain.
NFTs are a digital crypto-asset and have become incredibly popular in just the past 18 months as investors buy and trade the hot asset class, with the “non-fungible” nature of the digital object meaning it is unique or individual.
Penfolds has partnered with BlockBar, one of the world’s leading NFT marketplaces. The single barrel NFT will be converted into 300 bottle NFTs at the date of bottling of the wine in October 2022.
The barrel NFT can be resold or transferred through the BlockBar platform but cannot be redeemed by the purchaser. The bottle NFTs can be resold or transferred through the BlockBar platform by the purchaser and can be redeemed by the purchaser for the physical bottle after October 2023.
