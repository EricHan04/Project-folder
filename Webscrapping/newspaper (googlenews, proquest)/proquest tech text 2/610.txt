AUSTRALIA’S only sporting brain bank is operating on one-off donations of $26,000 despite uncovering degenerative brain disease in AFL greats Polly Farmer and Danny Frawley.
More than 300 NRL and AFL athletes have pledged their brains to the bank when they pass away.
Hall of Fame Legend Farmer was the first AFL player diagnosed with CTE, a condition linked to repeated head knocks. Frawley’s wife, Anita, said in September Danny’s diagnosis had helped his family better understand brain injuries in the community.
Former AFL researcher Alan Pearce and clinical associate professor Michael Buckland effectively operate the brain bank, housed at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, pro-bono.
Pearce said yesterday the purpose of the research was to help players and develop methods to prevent dangerous head knocks, not to close down sporting codes.
The pair wanted to undertake a dozen research projects and more investigation but desperately needed funding.
“We got $26,000 in start-up funds and I have raised the lofty figure of $500 to date, when I ask for a small donation when I go on podcasts,” he said.
“If we could get more support of funding we could look CYE in people who are alive and it could lead to treatments or rehab that could improve the quality of life, even if we can’t stop it.
“There are so many things we can do and want to, but we aren’t in the position to because of lack of funding.
“The research is to show the risks that we need to mitigate. “We want to look after players more effectively.” The initial start-up funds included $6000 from private companies and $20,000 from local health districts which are part of NSW Health.
“Because CTE is linked to physical trauma in the brain, if we know it relates to a mechanism we have the opportunity to reduce the exposure of that mechanism,” Pearce said. Website: https://www.brainbank.org.au.
