The cost of that low-range speeding offence — anything from one to 10km/h over the limit — comes into force from July 1 this year and compares to just $100 in Western Australia, $123 in NSW, $183 in South Australia and $227 in Victoria.
There will be an even bigger hike in fines for Queenslanders found to be exceeding the posted limit by 11 to 20km/h, with that penalty jumping from $275 to $431, being caught between 21 and 30km/h over goes from $459 to $646, while the fine for 31-40km/h over leaps from $643 to $1078.
The fine for not wearing a seatbelt in Queensland will also more than double from $413 to $1078, with Queensland’s Transport Mark Bailey making no excuses for cracking down on such an unforgivable offence.
From November 2021 to the end of February this year, new smart cameras in the State — which use artificial intelligence to filter through images and discover offences — issued 47,668 fines, with 33,805 of those for using a mobile phone while driving and a staggering 13,875 fines for people not wearing a seatbelt.
“We’re getting tough, but you know it’s not that hard to solve — just do the right thing,” Mr Bailey said.
“Seat belts have been around 50 years, mobile phones have been around about 20 years, there’s no excuse.
“If we can stamp out these offences, we will go a long way towards making Queensland roads safer and reducing the number of lives lost on our roads.”
Queensland Police Superintendent Ray Rohweder said he was aware of people in his state visiting wrecking yards to a buy a part that would slot into the seatbelt in their vehicles to stop the noisy alarms going off, “just to avoid wearing a seatbelt”.
Superintendent Rohweder said the changes to the fines were designed to save lives and encourage drivers to obey the road rules.
“A fatality just doesn‘t affect that person, as Minister Ryan said. It’s first responders, it’s families, it’s friends,” he said.
Queensland state opposition leader David Crisafulli said more needed to be done to address driver behaviour on Queensland roads.
“I don‘t want to see the government getting addicted to revenue from increased fines,” he said.
“That money has to drive cultural change to make people safer.”
Around $40.6 million in revenue for the Department of Transport and Main Roads was generated in Queensland from the 47,668 issues in the first four months of the cameras being in use. There have been 81 road deaths in Queensland so far this year.
Mr Bailey vowed that every cent collected from the fines would be reinvested into road safety.
South Australia does still slightly outdo Queensland when it comes to higher-speed offences, with the fine for doing between 30 and 45km/h over the limit a whopping $1529.
