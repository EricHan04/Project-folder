SA Water is going hi-tech in its water conservation fight, setting up at Adelaide’s home of innovation, Lot Fourteen at the old Royal Adelaide Hospital site.
The partnership with Stone and Chalk Startup Hub will find new ways to locate water main leaks, predict water use according to climate patterns, strengthen cyber security, help irrigators and plan infrastructure.
Artificial intelligence and satellite images will be used to identify vegetation growth patterns being fed by water pipe leaks. Farmers will be helped to employ the best irrigation practices, including the right times to make the most efficient use of water. Making the state’s water and sewage systems less vulnerable to cyber attacks is another goal, as is identifying areas susceptible to extreme weather.
