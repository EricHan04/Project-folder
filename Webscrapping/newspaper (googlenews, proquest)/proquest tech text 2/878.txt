RACE 1: 12:20PM VOBIS GOLD HEATH (2000M)
MAHAMEDEIS (2) looks the horse to beat. Hard fit and loves the distance. Flashed late to grab third in the Group 3 Easter Cup behind Hang Man and Persan, so on that alone should be hard to beat. Cannot fault FANCIFUL TOFF (4) having won or run second in each of the past four starts. MOONLIGHT MAID (1) has obvious ability but last win was October 2019. Market moves? DECLARES WAR (3) and BARRY THE BAPTIST (5) the pick of the roughies. Declares War won three on the bounce before faltering in the Albury Cup. Three times a winner at 2000 metres.
SUGGESTED BET: MAHAMEDEIS win
TAB MARKET MOVER: MAHAMEDEIS ($2.25 – $1.90)
RACE 2: 12.55PM BENCHMARK 78 HANDICAP (1400M)
SPRING CHOICE (8) gave Shandy a fright at big odds at Sandown last start. Gets William Pike in the saddle and drawn perfectly to be in the finish. Listed winner as a three-year-old before two extended breaks. Must be respected. SOMERSET MAUGHAM (2) needs further to be a strong winning chance but on class alone has to be included. DICE ROLL (9) one of the most interesting runners on the card. Group 3 winner in France and placed in the 2018 French Guineas. Flopped in Hong Kong but stable confidence suggests forward showing.
SUGGESTED BET: DICE ROLL each-way
TAB MARKET MOVER: DICE ROLL ($16 – $7), SPRING CHOICE ($7 – $5.50)
RACE 3: 1.30PM VOBIS SIRES GUINEAS (1600M)
BEAU ROSSA (3) is chasing a hat-track after wins at Morphettville and a formidable seven-length Sandown romp last start for Will Clarken and Jamie Kah. This is harder but drawn perfectly and looks to have oodles of upside. RIPPER RITA (13) has been a model of consistency in five career starts, a win and three minor placings, including performances at higher levels. Never got a clear run at them last start and should be in the finish again despite the shocking draw. MISS INBETWEEN got the bob last start. Up in grade but gets conditions to suit, while BLACK PENN (4) open to improvement after being cluttered up in traffic last start.
SUGGESTED BET: BEAU ROSSA win
TAB MARKET MOVER: BEAU ROSSA ($1.90 – $1.75)
RACE 4: 2.05PM VOBIS GOLD MILE (1600M)
MR QUICKIE (1) is the best horse in the race by some margin. Small fields tend to throw up some odd results but popular swooper has the tactical speed to get out of trouble. Just wins, with even luck. SO SI BON (2) is always around the mark and especially at this level. The evergreen galloper will look the winner at some point. GALAXY RAIDER (6) caught the eye fresh running third behind Mr Quickie and Still A Star. Won and placed three times second-up previously. Include in any exotics.
SUGGESTED BET: MR QUICKIE win
TAB MARKET MOVER: MR QUICKIE ($2.30 – $1.75)
RACE 5: 2.45PM VOBIS GOLD DASH (1100M)
SHELBY COBRA (1) resumes after a five-month break but has the class to figure in the finish despite a wide barrier. Stable harbours spring ambitions for the progressive sprinter, who should only improve with more racing. LA MEXICANA (2) finds another gear on rain-affected ground. Won three of her past five starts. BELLA NIPOTINA (5) a model of consistency and deserves another win. CAPRICCIO (7) bobbed up at big odds to win last start, while FOREVER FREE (8) has the class to be in the finish despite failing at past two outings. THE BIG EASY (9) and DARK HORSE (11) next best.
SUGGESTED BET: LA MEXICANA win
TAB MARKET MOVER: LA MEXICANA ($4 – $3.60)
RACE 6: 3.25PM THE SHOWDOWN (1200M)
STARRY LEGEND (2) has made good two-year-olds look average in his first two starts. Will be popular despite stepping to 1200 metres for the first time. If he settles in the run, he wins. ARCADED (10) the testing material and last-start Group 3 winner. Bolted in to win the Group 2 Blue Diamond Prelude in the early autumn. SLIDERS (11) the second Godolphin runner and the Blue Army has dominated two-year-old racing this season. Jumped out smartly before Victorian debut flop at Caulfield. Forgive. FINANCE TYCOON (1) been racing against some of the best two-year-olds in the country for two wins and a second from five career starts. LITERARY MAGNATE (13) won her Warrnambool maiden in breathtaking fashion on heavy ground.
SUGGESTED BET: ARCADED win
TAB MARKET MOVER: FINANCE TYCOON ($8 – $5), SLIDERS ($17 – $12)
RACE 7: 4.05PM BEL ESPRIT STAKES (1100M)
ANCESTRY (1) showed his customary speed at Mornington but punctured over the final stages. Back to 1100 metres, which should suit him better again. LYRE (3) always around the mark but rarely wins out of turn. Gets her chance again after back-to-back seconds. RUBISAKI (7) has the talent to blow them away but failed to come up last preparation. Given a good break since and won a jump out at Cranbourne recently. SISSTAR (9) and ALFA ORO (10) class runners also. Sisstar shooting for three wins on the trot while Alfa Oro could be Adelaide bound with a good performance. Ran third resuming at Caulfield behind Sword Of Mercy and Diamond Effort. Should relish the speed in the race.
SUGGESTED BET: SISSTAR each-way
TAB MARKET MOVER: ALFA ORO ($4.80 – $4)
RACE 8: 4.40PM VOBIS GOLD SPRINT (1200M)
LAVERROD (1) broke through for a stylish win in the Listed Hareeba Stakes at Mornington last start. William Pike on again and the Toronado gelding has never missed the placings (8: 3-3-2) at 1200 metres. Looks the horse to beat again. HOW WOMANTIC (3) will be up on the speed and hard to run down. Finished behind Laverrod at Mornington last start. Respect. SAM’S IMAGE was an impressive winner at Bendigo, when first-up after a long break. Struggled with feet issues previously but they’re a distance memory now. A definite each-way chance. PAUL’S REGRET (11) ran second to Probabeel at Caulfield only two starts back.
SUGGESTED BET: LAVERROD win
TAB MARKET MOVER: PAUL’S REGRET ($7 – $5.50)
RACE 9: 5.20PM VOBIS GOLD DISTAFF (1400M)
LUNAKORN (10) at her best could be winning. Forget she went around last start, never a factor running last of 10 in the Group 3 Matron Stakes at Flemington. Form prior strong enough to win but monitor conditions as goes best on top of the ground. LA CHEVALEE (5) won first-up last preparation. Drawn out alongside Lunakorn but with even luck should be in the finish. GOOD AND PROPER been in a rich vein of form, runner-up past two starts after back-to-back wins. Will get back from barrier four so could need favours in the straight to get into clear galloping room. First-emergency SHAHZADE (17) loves getting a toe in the ground and if they’re swooping, will be a factor late.
SUGGESTED BET: LUNAKORN win
