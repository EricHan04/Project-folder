CRYPTOCURRENCIES BPS FINANCIAL misrepresented the usefulness of its cryptocurrency, known a Qoin, in a breach of financial services laws, the corporate regulator alleges.
In filings with the Federal Court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission claims the company told more than 79,000 individuals and entities that Qoin was a regulated product and could be widely used when it could not. Qoin was created by Tony Wiese and Raj Pathak, both directors of barter-trading system Bartercard Australia. Qoin is exclusively bought and sold on Block Trade Exchange, a platform which is owned by the same company as the currency. The industry body, Blockchain Australia, expelled the Gold Coast-based company in February 2021. ASIC alleges BPS made “false or misleading representations that a person who purchases crypto-assets associated with (Qoin) can be confident that, if and when they wished to do so, they will be able to exchange those Qoin Tokens for fiat currency or for other crypto-assets through independent exchanges”.
