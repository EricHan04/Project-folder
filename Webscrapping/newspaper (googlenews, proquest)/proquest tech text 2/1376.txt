The Adelaide company, which has attracted pre-IPO investments from Microequities Asset Management and listed fund manager MA Financial, specialises in process and sales optimisation, and counts Pfizer, Pernod Ricard and Dulux group among its clients.
Complexica is on the hunt nationally for software firms with up to about $15m in revenue, which have an established product and customer base, but are yet to realise the gains possible from AI and machine learning.
Complexica managing director Matt Michalewicz said it was still early days in terms of the digitalisation of many business processes, and there was a lot of opportunity still to come in applying AI to logistics, sales, and other applications where complex decision-making processes were at play.
“2021 was a transformational year … where we raised close to $20m in capital, expanded our management team with some very experienced hires,’’ he said.
“I am excited about where Complexica has gotten to, and what the immediate future holds for the company, its staff, customers, and investors.”
Complexica has raised $19m in pre-IPO growth funding since late last year, with a view to listing potentially later this year.
While revenue figures for Complexica are not public, the company says it now employs more than 100 staff and is growing at 50 per cent a year, with overseas expansion plans on the cards.
The company also recently won the Kellogg’s account across Australia and New Zealand to optimise its trade promotion activities.
The Complexica team, including Mr Michalewicz’s father Zbigniew and chief software architect Constantine Chiriac, previously founded SolveIt Software which they sold to Schneider Electric in 2012.
