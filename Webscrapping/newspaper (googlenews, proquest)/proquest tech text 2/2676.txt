WORKERS who copy last year’s deductions into this year’s tax return are in the crosshairs of the Australian Taxation Office after COVID reshaped employment habits.
The ATO is warning people about work-related claims for car, travel and other expenses it expects to see this year, and plans to come down hard on “copy and paste” deductions.
New ATO data shows work-related deductions rose last year, from $18.7bn to $19.4bn, as more people worked from home, and it says the working-from-home trend is likely to push claims higher again this year.
But its data analytics systems would spot people who worked largely at home but maintained their level of deductions for car, travel or clothing, ATO assistant commissioner Tim Loh said. “You can’t be in two places at once,” he said.
