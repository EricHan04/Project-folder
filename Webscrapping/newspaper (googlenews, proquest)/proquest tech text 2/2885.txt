INSOLVENCIES AUSTRALIAN women-only ridesharing business Shebah has been placed into voluntary administration, with the company seeking a sale or a restructure after it was decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Shebah chief executive Georgina McEncroe, a former comedian, said revenues had plummeted by 70 per cent due to school and workplace closures across Victoria and New South Wales.
Sam Kaso and Rachel Burdett of Cor Cordis have been appointed administrators to Shebah, which set crowd-funding records in 2019 when it raised $3m from 2100 investors, 94 per cent of whom were women.
Ms McEncroe said Shebah has a pool of 1000 drivers but less than half have been active during lockdowns.
The company offers a female-friendly ridesharing service, only allowing women drivers and allowing women, unaccompanied children or men travelling with car seats to ride in its vehicles.
“I just feel really disappointed but I’m hopeful the administrators can get a sale and the shareholders can get some of their money back if not all, and that the service can continue,” Ms McEncroe said. “I think a tech company could easily purchase it and do some of the things with it that we were one day hoping to do.” Financial documents show Shebah, based in Melbourne, was growing at around 8 per cent month-on-month before the pandemic hit.
The company turned over $1.8m in 2018, up from $500,000 in 2017. The company was operating in most of the major cities across the country. Mr Kaso said he would try to save the company through a sale or restructure. “Shebah will continue to operate as normal while we stabilise the business and assess the operations before calling for expressions of interest,”he said.
