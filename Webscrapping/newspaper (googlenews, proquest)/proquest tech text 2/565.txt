JOUST co-founder Mark Bevan has resigned from the fintech company six months after its merger with a previous competitor in online lending.
Mr Bevan will be replaced by John Maxwell as head of sales at the company, which relocated its head office to Sydney following its merger with Sydney-based Loan­Dolphin in May.
Mr Bevan remained in Adelaide following the merger, serving as head of sales and distribution.
He said the company was well placed for growth under the new structure, and it was the right time to step back from the business after almost six years.
“I see this as the perfect opportunity to step away from the Joust business. With the timing in the run-up to Christmas, it gives me the chance to enjoy my first holiday since 2015 — such is the life of a fintech start-up founder,” he said. The Joust platform launched in 2016 with the backing of a few investors, including Adelaide Football Club chairman and former BankSA managing director Rob Chapman.
