WHAT if a pen could alert you to mistakes as you write and supply the correct spelling, as well as scan text and translate it into an earpiece?
The concept by a trio of St Aloysius College Year 7s, aimed at helping people with dyslexia, has won them a place in the final of a national competition.
Microsoft’s AI For Good Idea Challenge tasks students with coming up with a concept where artificial intelligence could solve social or environmental issues.
St Aloysius girls Momina Rezayee, Layla De Pasquale and Madeline Belperio will present their idea, including a mock-up prototype, to a judging panel in Sydney today.
Scanning pens that display word definitions and read text aloud to support dyslexic children are already on the market. The students’ idea is to make it a working pen for writing too, with a vibrating function to alert the user to spelling mistakes and a screen to display the correct spelling.“The more you use it the better it becomes,” their teacher Meng Sun says of its AI element.
