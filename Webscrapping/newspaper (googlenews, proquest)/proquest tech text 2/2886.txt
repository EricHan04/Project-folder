INDIA’S coronavirus crisis has triggered an outpouring of generosity across the world – and we are being asked to help.
Leading international aidorganisation CARE Australia is calling on Aussies to assist India as the country battles the worst COVID-19 wave.
CARE is helping people in India with critical medical supplies, soap and clean water, relying on the support of Australian donations.
The CEO of the Indian Link Media Group in Australia, Pawan Luthra, said he was receiving up to 500 messages a day from friends and families in India asking for help.
“All are asking ‘Can you help us get a hospital bed? Can you help us get into ICU? Can you organise oxygen tanks for us? And where do I get medicines?’,” he said.
Mr Luthra said Indian communities in Australia were galvanising a war chest of a few million dollars to buy equipment and have it flown to India.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Tuesday Australia would send 500 ventilators, a million surgical masks, 500,000 PPE masks, 100,000 surgical gowns, 100,000 goggles, 100,000 pairs of gloves and 20,000 face shields from the national stockpile.
Indian online crowd-funding website Ketto has set up a campaign to help hospitals across the country get immediate access to oxygen concentrators and have called for Australian support.
Hindu Benevolent Fund is an Australian organisation working with leading non-government organisations to provide oxygen, manage a 500-bed isolation centre and co-ordinate plasma donation. Australians can donate direct as they can to the Mumbai-based GiveIndia and the Hemkunt Foundation, both working to provide oxygen to COVID patients in need.
