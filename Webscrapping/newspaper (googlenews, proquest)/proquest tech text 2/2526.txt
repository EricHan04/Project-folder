THE Southern Adelaide Local Health Network will get an acting chief executive for a full year in the hope state and international borders will open to allow a comprehensive talent search.
It will also have an acting chief finance officer and acting chief operating officer.
Former chief executive Susan O’Neill resigned abruptly in May and her place has been filled on an interim basis by chief operating officer David Morris but he is going to a new digital health job.
The network’s board chairman, Mark Butcher, said chief finance officer Wayne Gadd would be acting chief executive for 12 months, Sarah Woon would be acting chief operating officer and John O’Connor would be acting chief finance officer.
“Due to a range of unexpected circumstances, including Covid-19 travel restrictions, the board has been unable to expedite the appointment of a new CEO,” Mr Butcher said. “As a result, Wayne Gadd will take on the role of acting CEO commencing August 30 and will hold this role for 12 months. Recruitment for a more permanent CEO will recommence in early 2022.”
