INDEPENDENT Boothby candidate Jo Dyer says she is running her campaign “on the smell of an oily rag” after revealing the identities of donors who have pledged more than $1000.
Her online crowd-funding campaign has attracted 854 donors, amassing more than $96,000 in cash.
She also recently secured a $20,000 donation from businessman Simon Holmes a Court’s Climate 200 activist group. The largest single donor was celebrated theatre director Michael Kantor, who gave $10,000, but Ms Dyer says her campaign coffers are shallow compared with the major parties.
“Relative to the money pouring in for the major party candidates, our campaign is running on the smell of an oily rag and the passion of our volunteers,” she said.
Mr Kantor was the artistic director of the Malthouse Theatre and worked with Ms Dyer on his 2013 debut feature film, The Boy Castaways.
“All our money is immediately committed to leaflets, corflutes and other campaign collateral, so this donation was a welcome surprise,” Ms Dyer said.
Ms Dyer urged all political candidates to show the same level of transparency by revealing the identities of those who donate more than $1000.
Under current rules, candidates are only required to identify donors who contribute more than $14,500 in one hit.
Ms Dyer called for donations on GoFundMe, which attracted dozens of anonymous benefactors.
This was despite previously saying hidden pledges showed an “astonishing dereliction of ethics and accountability”.
Ms Dyer revealed in a press release Mr Kantor, the nephew of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, had recently made his $10,000 donation.
It was initially listed as “anonymous” on her GoFundMe page, but Ms Dyer has since published the details online. A federal government spokesman said political parties were “subject to a rigorous funding and financial disclosure regime”.
