WATER customers in Adelaide have the longest unplanned interruptions to their supply in the country – and the problem is getting worse.
A Bureau of Meteorology report found the average time SA Water customers waited for fixes in 2018-19, including after burst water mains, was more than four hours.
That was slightly worse than the previous year, and well above other capitals. Sydney had the second longest average wait at two hours and 23 minutes. Melbourne customers waited 95 minutes.
An SA Water spokeswoman said the company had been working to lessen waiting times through better data capture and work practices.
“Key examples include training more field crew members to operate valves as part of water main repairs, investigating innovative ways of isolating, repairing and restoring the water network, and optimising resources for repairs in regional areas with the longest repair time,” she said.SA Water is also looking at using more smart technology.
