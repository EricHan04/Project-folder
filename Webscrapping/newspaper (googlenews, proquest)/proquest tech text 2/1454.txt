LIGHT, technology, music and art will bring the city to life as winter festival Illuminate Adelaide delivers its first event in July.
The program will feature 150 installations and performances throughout the city from July 16 to August 1. It will also include a new version of the Festival of Ideas, in partnership with the University of Adelaide.
Illuminate artistic directors Lee Cumberlidge and Rachael Azzopardi said they wanted to explore the intersection between art and technology.
“We really wanted to focus on some of the great things that are being made here in SA – the future technology companies that are making incredible work in AI (artificial intelligence) or VFX (visual effects) or the game industry or VR (virtual reality) as well,” Mr Cumberlidge said.
Ms Azzopardi said many of the works, were “experiential” rather than simply visual. The full program will be released in May. SATURDAY: 28-PAGE ILLUMINATE ADELAIDE HIGHLIGHTS PROGRAM
