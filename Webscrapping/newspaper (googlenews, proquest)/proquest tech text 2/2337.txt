ROBUST annual growth of 6 per cent over the next decade is the ambitious target of a new plan to supercharge South Australia’s hi-tech sector.
The State Government yesterday released the Hi-Tech Sector Plan 2030, which was created in conjunction with more than 60 representatives in the industry over the past year, in a bid to map a path for growth and job creation.
The plan identified eight areas to exploit for growth: advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0; artificial intell­igence, machine learning and data analytics; blockchain; computer vision, aug­men­ted and virtual reality; cybersecurity; the Internet of Things; optics and photonics; and quantum computing.
Four priorities identified in the plan are: strengthening technical capability; improving connections and collaboration; building new jobs and career pathways; and better market access and development.
Skills Minister David Pisoni, pictured, said the government would commit an extra $2.5m to continue the GigCity fast, affordable internet program for businesses until 2024 to boost the sector.
“SA is uniquely positioned for leading this vibrant and rapidly-advancing sector, which contributes $122bn annually to the Australian economy and employs nearly 580,000 people,” he said. “As we enter a new decade faced with increasingly complex economic and industrial environments … building capability in SA’s hi-tech sector and growing a skilled workforce has never been more important.”
