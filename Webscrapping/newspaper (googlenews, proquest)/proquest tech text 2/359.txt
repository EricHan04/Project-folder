OUR farmers, winemakers, fishermen and miners, so often caught on the wrong side of commodity price swings or simple bad weather, are having a great start to the year.
It is excellent news that merchandise exports from South Australia are currently tracking at record levels, and while detailed figures are not available right now, the trend appears to be widespread across our major export industries.
The mining sector, bolstered by high prices, but also the start-up of a significant new project in OZ Minerals’ Carrapateena copper and gold mine, is doing well, and the grains industry has just brought in what is tipped to be its fourth biggest harvest on record.
The wine sector has had to deal with bruising Chinese tariffs, but with this year’s vintage the best, some say, in decades, there’s plenty of reason for optimism there as well.
The strong export figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday underline the importance of the regions to South Australia. As we emerge from the pandemic crisis, here’s hoping the strong momentum continues. Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Matt Deighton, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, SA ,5000
