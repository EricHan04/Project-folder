SINCE 1984, Webb Helicopters has provided extensive services to local, interstate and remote operations - from Cairns to the Central Highlands, to the Bowen, Galilee and Surat Basins, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia.
Managing director, Eric Webb, said Webb Helicopters would again offer regrowth management services to the state's graziers this winter.
"Vegetation regrowth is mainly of concern in the brigalow belt," Mr Webb said.
"That takes in St George and Goondiwindi, Roma, Nebo and Injune."
Mr Webb said that to control regrowth on grazing country, herbicides should be applied now.
"It's best that management happens during winter," he said.
"We're trying to avoid any huge rainfall - we want only a light rainfall.
"Using granular herbicide pellets graziers, can effectively target only the species they want to, leaving behind the bigger trees."
Tebulex 200 GR is an economical choice for the control of brigalow and teatree growth, Mimosa pigra and certain problem woody weeds on grazing lands.
Mr Webb said the product had been a popular choice for many years.
"We've been using the pellets for years and years," he said.
"In that time, we've had lots of success in containing regrowth."
