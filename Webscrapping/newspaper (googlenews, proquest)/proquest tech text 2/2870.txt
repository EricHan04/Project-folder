FASHION TALK about timing. For the second time in as many years, Outland Denim conducted crowd-funding campaigns as Covid-19 was wreaking havoc around the country.
“Last year the lockdown fell upon us right as we were launching, quite similar to this time,” co-founder James Bartle said.
But it appears that, like last year, grassroots investors were still happy to invest in the company that is based on ethics and sustainability, and most specifically as a way to keep women in Cambodia out of the human trafficking cycle.
The second round resulted in similar results to the first, and just shy of Mr Bartle’s hopes for the campaign.
A total of 890 investors took up the offer, raising $898,000. Just over half of the investors were women, 95 per cent were Australian residents and 65 per cent invested less than $1000. Like many fashion brands, Outland faced challenges when the pandemic hit, including a six-month closure of its Cambodian facility and the loss of its global department store accounts.
The brand quickly invested in its digital strategy and infrastructure, switched to a largely direct-to-consumer model and managed overall growth of 92 per cent.
Mr Bartle believes that this has helped with the second round of investing. “We’ve had 12 months of proving to our investors that we can deliver, and also that we didn’t go under during Covid,” he said.
The first round of investment in 2020 raised $1.32m from 1000 investors. Mr Bartle said the company, which he co-founded with wife Erica, would potentially look at a third and final round of funding, either via crowd-funding or private equity. Meghan Markle wore a pair of Outland Denim jeans on her Australian tour with Prince Harry in 2016, resulting in global recognition for the brand.
