HEALTH AUSTRALIA’S biggest health fund Medibank is doubling down on virtual health, investing $10m in a start-up that allows video and audio GP consultations, as well as door-to-door delivery of prescription medication.
Medibank will take a minority stake in Medinet – launched in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic catapulted telehealth into the mainstream – and deploy its services to policyholders as part of its preventive health arsenal.
About 10,000 people use Medinet services a day, ranking in the top five most downloaded health apps in Australia. Medibank executive Andrew Wilson said the $10m investment would allow Medinet to further scale and develop its technology, reaching more patients. It comes as Medibank has been unleashing its balance sheet to secure a number of deals, which include taking minority stakes in short-stay hospitals in an effort to rein in out-of-pocket costs. But Dr Wilson said virtual health was not for everyone and all conditions, therefore it would not replace face-to-face GP consultations.
