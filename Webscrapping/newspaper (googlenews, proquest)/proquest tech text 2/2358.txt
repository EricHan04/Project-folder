A MELBOURNE-based cryptocurrency exchange that claimed to have signed up more than 20,000 users has collapsed amid calls for a crackdown on the largely unregulated platforms used to trade assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The failure of myCryptoWallet is just the latest collapse in the sector, with Melbourne’s Blockchain Global, which ran the ACX trading platform, placed in voluntary administration in October owing investors a reported $21m, and high-profile failures internationally in recent years, including the massive Mt Gox collapse.
Jaryd Koenigsmann, 28, launched myCryptoWallet in 2017, with the platform claiming that it provides “a user-friendly, customer-centric, all-inclusive digital currency service, with a serious and mindful approach to maintaining a high-level of security and customer safety’’.
But users of the exchange, which can be used to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, claim they could not transfer money out of the platform, and many have complained that they have struggled to get a response from it.
“No response via email. Outlined complaint. Will be filing complaint with ACCC ... and ASIC,’’ one user said.
Mr Koenigsmann was loathe to shed any light on the matter on Monday, hanging up on The Advertiser when contacted. Terry van der Velde, of SV Partners, was appointed as liquidator of the company and will produce a report to creditors later this month. An October report from the Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology has recommended cryptocurrency exchanges such as myCryptoWallet be regulated to provide assurance to both cryptocurrency and fintech investors.
