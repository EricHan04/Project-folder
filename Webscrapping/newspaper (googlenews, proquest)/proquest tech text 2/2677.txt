MORE than 800 Australian businesses have made a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner, new ­research has found.
Australia’s biggest ever analysis of net zero commitments made by companies has found there are 833 businesses which have pledged to get to net zero. These include companies as diverse as transport infrastructure giant Sydney Airport and vitamins and supplements maker Blackmores, who have set carbon neutral targets for 2030.
And, as previously reported, supermarket giant Coles has signed the last of its electricity agreements to be 100 per cent renewably powered by 2025.
The report will be released today by data analytics provider Purpose Bureau and is the largest analysis of net zero commitments made in Australia to date. Purpose Bureau CEO Nick Kamper said more than 800 Aussie businesses have made commitments to be carbon neutral by at least 2050.
“This is a huge effort and puts private sector momentum well ahead of the government,” he said.
Mr Kamper (inset top) said the number was expected to grow as businesses interacted more with suppliers and customers who were carbon neutral or wanted carbon neutral ­products.” See the full list online: missionzero2050.com.au
