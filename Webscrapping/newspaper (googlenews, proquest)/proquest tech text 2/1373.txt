ARTIFICIAL intelligence ­outfit Complexica, which is looking to list on the ASX in the medium term, is on the hunt for software companies it can acquire and inject its AI smarts into.
The Adelaide company, which has attracted pre-IPO investments from Microequities Asset Management and listed fund manager MA Financial, specialises in process and sales optimisation, and counts Pfizer, Pernod Ricard and Dulux Group among its clients.
Complexica co-founder and managing director Matt Michalewicz said the company was putting together an M&A strategy that would augment its organic growth over the next two financial years.
It is on the hunt nationally for software firms with up to about $15m in revenue, which have an established product and customer base, but which are yet to realise the gains that can be delivered from AI and machine learning.
Mr Michalewicz said it was still early days in terms of the digitalisation of many business processes, and there was a lot of opportunity still to come in applying AI to logistics, sales, and other applications where there were complex decision-making processes at play. Mr Michalewicz said 2021 was a transformational year for Complexica, “where we raised close to $20m in capital, expanded our management team with some very experienced and seasoned hires, and added several dozen new staff along with a Sydney office”.
