ALIEN worlds converge with sexual relationships in a new exhibition that is literally touchy-feely.
UniSA’s museum of discovery is the setting for HEDONISM, which opens this weekend with the aim to explore pleasure – and consent – in a family-friendly way.
MOD. senior exhibition manager Dr Lisa Bailey said the exhibition was an interactive game loaded with sexual subtext for all ages.
“Obviously, consent is really important when you’re talking about sexual relationships but we have built an exhibit about consent that doesn't talk about sex explicitly,” Dr Bailey said.
“So it is a metaphor and some of the metaphors aren’t too subtle but anyone can come and play the game.” Participants are invited to connect with an alien being and follow certain protocols and the principles of consent. “You’re guided through each of the exhibits, trying to forge a relationship with the alien,” Dr Bailey said.
“You’ve got to listen to what the alien is telling you about the things that it likes and it doesn’t like, or whether or not it’s changed its mind about letting you explore itself,” Dr Bailey said.
MOD. director Dr Kristin Alford said the exhibit was developed in conjunction with the Consent Matters course that the university offers as part of the national initiative Respect. Now. Always. from Universities Australia, to help reduce the incidence of sexual assault.
“If you try to rush the (alien’s) artificial intelligence, it will express disappointment in you,” Dr Alford said.
“So ... the way to win is by respecting the relationship that you’ve built.” HEDONISM IS FREE AT MOD. ON NORTH TCE UNTILNOVEMBER. SEE MOD.ORG.AU
