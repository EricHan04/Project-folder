A SOPHISTICATED attempt to rig an Australian election was disrupted by domestic spy agency ASIO, it has been revealed.
ASIO director-general Mike Burgess revealed tantalising details of the case, which were directed by a man he dubbed “the puppeteer’’ and bankrolled through an offshore account.
“This year – a federal election year – we need to be particularly on guard against foreign political interference,’’ Mr Burgess told a crowd of intelligence community figures at his third annual threat assessment in Canberra on Wednesday night.
“I can confirm that ASIO recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot in the lead-up to an election in Australia,” he said.
He would not reveal the jurisdiction or election involved, or the foreign interest behind the plot, although it has all the hallmarks of a Chinese Communist Party-backed operation.
Mr Burgess said the puppeteer had hired a person to enable the foreign-influence operation and funded it with hundreds of thousands of dollars accessed through an offshore bank account.
The plot involved the employee identifying candidates to run in an election based on whether they supported the foreign government or were considered vulnerable to “inducements or cultivation”.
“Secretly shaping the jurisdiction’s political scene to benefit the foreign power was considered a key performance indicator.
“It was like a foreign interference start-up,’’ he said.
“The employee used existing relationships with politicians, staffers and journalists to select potential targets, without revealing the secret intent, the foreign connection or the puppeteer’s involvement,’’ Mr Burgess said. He said the puppeteer and the hired employee plotted ways to advance the candidates’ campaigns through financial support, planting stories in foreign language media, and investigated hiring political consultants, advertising agencies and PR companies.
