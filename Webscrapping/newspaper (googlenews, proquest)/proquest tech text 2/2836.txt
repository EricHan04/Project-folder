Measured on the number of donations made per capita, Bundaberg has taken out the gong.
According to GoFundMe’s annual report 2020 Year in Giving, the town was followed by Wagga Wagga, Mackay, Mandurah and Launceston.
A campaign to help save Kangaroo Island’s koalas and wildlife received the most donations in Australia through the fundraising platform this year, smashing its initial target of $15,000 by raising $2,693,720 as of Wednesday.
It’s become the second biggest national campaign on GoFundMe.
Bushfire fundraising was prominent in the top five list, with the ‘Fire Relief Fund First Nations Communities’ campaign coming in second, raising $1.88 million.
GoFundMe revealed 1.3 million donations were made by Australians in 2020, up 30 per cent from 2019.
Donations to community fundraisers more than doubled - up 124 per cent.
More than $31 million was donated in January alone — raised by 450,000 donors — for Black Summer bushfire recovery.
More than $6 million was donated to Indigenous rights causes, with this year’s donations tripling from 2019.
GoFundMe Australia regional manager Nicola Britton said the response from everyday Australians making donations was “nothing short of remarkable”.
“At the heart of the response is community. Community means something different for each and every Australian - we have seen community generosity in ways not witnessed before,” she said.
“The power of collective action saw Australians stand together to drive unparalleled generosity to help loved ones, neighbours and strangers in need.
“The trends seen on GoFundMe can often be an early warning sign of emerging societal issues, of a group of citizens falling through the cracks.
“This year saw more Australians turn to crowd-funding for needs that fall outside of traditional government or charitable support, from stranded travellers covering quarantine fees to return home, to bushfire-impacted farmers in need of fencing and PPE for frontline medical professionals.”
