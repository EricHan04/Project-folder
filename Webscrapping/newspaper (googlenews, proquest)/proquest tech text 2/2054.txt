EQUITIES The sharemarket continued its surge higher on Thursday, driven by further gains in the big banks.
The financials sector, which had been left behind over recent months, has rallied strongly this week and is up a whopping 15 per cent over the past four days.
The strength in the sector sent the ASX 200 as much as 2.4 per cent higher in Thursday’s session, pushing the benchmark index past the 5900 level for the first time since March 10.
The rally eased in the afternoon and the index closed up 76 points, or 1.32 per cent, at 5851.1. The All Ords gained 73 points, or 1.24 per cent, to 5957.8.
Global optimism was a key driver, fed by comments from Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe who said the local economy was not as bad as the central bank had previously envisaged.
Answering questions at a Senate committee hearing, Dr Lowe said his “main concern is that we don’t withdraw the fiscal stimulus too early”, while he also said interest rates were as low as they could go.
Those comments, along with better-than-expected capital expenditure data from the Bureau of Statistics, helped the Australian dollar to trade up 0.1 per cent to US66.26c at the local close.
“Private new capital expenditure fell 1.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. This was a smaller fall than expected, with rises in mining and manufacturing capex offsetting a decline in other industries,” said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch. “But it was still the weakest quarterly level since 2009, even before more severe impacts of the pandemic materialise.” Among equities, the financials were the standout for a second day as JP Morgan joined the chorus backing the banks, saying their rally was “well overdue”.
ANZ jumped 4.5 per cent to $18.74, Westpac rose 4.4 per cent to $18.39, NAB closed up 4.7 per cent to $18.79 and Commonwealth Bank added 2.2 per cent to $65.73.
Bendigo and Adelaide Bank told the market it was setting aside $148m in provisions for COVID-19 as its shares added 4.1 per cent to $6.55.
Energy stocks were a drag on the market as oil prices ticked lower overnight. Woodside fell 2 per cent to $23.07, Santos dropped 3.2 per cent to $5.44 and Beach Energy felt the sting of a broker downgrade, falling 6.2 per cent to $1.60.
Vitamins maker Blackmores resumed trading and closed up 3.3 per cent to $81.42 after completing a $92m placement, while toll road operator Atlas Arteria was in a trading halt pending its own $495m raising. Its shares last traded at $6.70.
Nearmap was the most improved stock on the market after a positive trading update and as it launched a new artificial intelligence offering. Shares in the aerial mapping group surged 16.7 per cent to $2.24.
Across the rest of the tech sector, Appen lost 2.2 per cent to $30.70, Afterpay rose 1.9 per cent to $46.09 and Xero ticked up 0.4 per cent to $85.
