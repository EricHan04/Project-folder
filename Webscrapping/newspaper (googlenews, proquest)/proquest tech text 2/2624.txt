Brisbane Grammar School student and award recipient, Elijah Wong wants to pursue a career as an orthopaedic surgeon after discovering his passion for problem solving.
“Throughout high school I was particularly passionate about mathematics and science, these subjects are very problem-solving based,” he said.
Meanwhile, Toowoomba Grammar School graduate and award recipient, Aaron Palmer completed an anatomy and physiology subject at university while at school.
Mr Palmer, who hopes to become a doctor, said his advice is to always aim high.
“My advice to other students is to aim for 100%, because even though you might not achieve it, you will be more than happy with your results that you received by working that hard and aiming that high,” he said.
Ms Grace said the high achievers came from schools across the state and were only the second cohort to graduate under the new system.
She said the awards reinforced that Queensland’s new senior curriculum and assessment system enabled students from across the state to reach their full potential.
“These award winners are the second cohort to graduate in the new QCE system and attended State, Catholic and independent schools from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, Ingham and Rockhampton,” Ms Grace said.
“This is also a proud day for the award winners’ families. I’m sure they are an important part of their children’s success.”
