You may not be able to take Dustin Martin’s big opening round score but picking a team now, without Richmond and Carlton players available, isn’t a big disadvantage at all.
In fact, picking now, with more knowledge of who’s playing in the other games, may even be an advantage.
Signing up to play Australia’s biggest and best fantasy game only takes a few minutes, but knowing who to pick in your team can be a daunting experience.
Clayton Oliver or Jack Macrae? Patrick Dangerfield or Steele Sidebottom? And who are all these cheapies I have never seen before?
Follow our tried and true formula below to set up a squad that will set you up for success. Remember every player is only locked from the first bounce of their respective games, starting with players from the Magpies and the Bulldogs on Friday night.

Remember to hit “save” when you’re done — and join a league with your mates to share the fun.
Note that this list is just a sample of all the players available for selection, but we’ve picked the names you should be able to rely on to score well relative to their starting value in 2021. You’re allowed to pick anyone you like! (But we would recommend avoiding Tyson Goldsack, who is on Port Adelaide’s list but is only expected to play in the SANFL this year).
OK, let’s get started.
A note on dual-position players: Some players can be picked in multiple positions — so, for example, a DEF/MID can be selected as a defender or a midfielder and a RUC/FWD can be added to your ruck or forward lines. Obviously each player can only be chosen once but adding some DPPs to your line-up is a smart move — they can be moved between positions during the season to help cover injuries or missing stars.

Hopefully you’ve now got a 30-man squad and some money left over. If that’s the case, you can go back and upgrade some of your players to more expensive options. More likely you will run out early especially if you pick the most expensive options in each position — downgrade some of those players to cheaper options to get 30 players under the $10 million salary cap. Then hit save!
Also, don't limit yourself to the players above. That should give you a competitive side, but add your own flavour if you have players you like or you’ve got your own mail — or a hunch — they will be a good fantasy pick this year.
