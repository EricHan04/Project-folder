CRYPTOCURRENCY consultancy Blockchain Global has had a winding-up application lodged against it for the second time this year.
Queensland-based Guangsen Nie and Keqi Yao this month lodged a winding-up application against the company that was behind the failed attempt to list Bitcoin Group on the ASX in 2016.
This follows a winding-up application that was lodged in May this year, and then dismissed in June.
Bitcoin Group, headed by cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Lee, lodged a prospectus with the ASX in July 2015, and was looking to raise $20m.
At the time it was touted as the first cryptocurrency miner in the world to run an initial public offer. However, the IPO was pulled and investors’ money refunded in early 2016.
This followed the prospectus being revised three times on orders from the Australian Securities & Investments Commission.
The company was aiming to earn 25-50 bitcoins per day through its bitcoin mining centres in China, which at the time would have generated about $32,000 a day, with bitcoin then valued at $640. At the current bitcoin price of $75,630, that mining rate would have generated $3.78m a day, or $1.37bn a year, depending on the company’s ability to maintain that rate.
The company rebranded as Blockchain Global in 2016.
The Australian has attempted to contact Bitcoin Global at each of its three Australian-based offices.
The lawyers for the individuals behind the court action have also been contacted. The winding-up application is set to return to the Federal Court in Brisbane on October 22.
