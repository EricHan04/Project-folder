It was only 9am and Catalina’s in Rose Bay was heaving thanks to an event put on by cult Australian Beauty brand MCoBeauty to celebrate their partnership with actor and social media phenomenon Celeste Barber.
Over 120 people attended, including celebrities Hugh Sheridan, Jules Sebastain and Erin Molan, with the brand’s founder and CEO Shelley Sullivan saying, “no one didn’t RSVP”.
“We are more excited we can all get together in one room. Do you know how many times we’ve tried to host an event over the last year. You know how much I love a party and an event, I think I’ve cancelled 15,” said Sullivan.
In an ironic twist the event was filled with the who’s who of the beauty influencers, including ex Married At First Sight bride Marta Kalifatidis, which is an industry Barber has made a career of poking fun of.
“I don’t have anything against [influencers] but I’m not one,” Barber joked of her sway. Before later adding, “now Sharon Stone uses the mascara, so, who cares.”
It’s been a profitable partnership for MCo.Beauty with sales increasing by 500 per cent in Woolworths after Barber aligned with the beauty brand, bringing an addition 1.5 million new customers into Woolworths. While rumours swirled Barber was paid well seven figures for her endorsement, a source told The Daily Telegraph that figure is grossly inflated.
Sheridan also rushed out of rehearsals for Hughman, his new show for the Adelaide Fringe, to attend the event. “Shelley and I have known each other since I was at NIDA and she was a single-mum trying to start up her brand in her garage. There was no way I was not going to attend the event,” he said. “I’m really really proud of what she’s achieved.”
