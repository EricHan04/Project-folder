FINDING career success in 2021 may take a little more effort than previous years, with the chaos of 2020 changing the job market and what companies look for in new hires.
But employers say workers, jobseekers and career changers can set themselves up for a fruitful year.

“Look at how you can differentiate yourself today and into the future,” he says. PROVE YOU CAN WORK AT A DISTANCE McAfee chief people officer Chatelle Lynch says jobseekers will need to demonstrate they can be part of a remote team, now that more people work from home.

Rackspace Technology chief technology officer Emma Pudney says there are also shortages in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, automation and cloud technologies.
