MIT will establish a Living Lab in Adelaide's Lot Fourteen innovation precinct.
Leading computer science university Massachusetts Institute of Technology will set-up a new research centre in Adelaide's Lot Fourteen CBD innovation precinct.
MIT will establish a Living Lab to bring together public and private research sectors and analyse data, Premier Steven Marshall said on Thursday.
“The Living Lab means local researchers will have access to invaluable data to identify how we can drive sustainable population growth, create jobs and strengthen our economy,” Mr Marshall said.
“Furthermore, it will bolster South Australia’s entrepreneurial activity across a range of industries and ensure that this state remains at the forefront of global innovation and enterprise.
“This Australian-first collaboration is a real game changer for South Australia, which helps us build a stronger and more prosperous economy that allows and encourages young people with ideas to stay here and pursue them.” 
Living Labs have already been successfully set up in overseas cities including New York, Istanbul and Beijing, where they provide information to help governments form policy and initiatives.
MIT media arts and sciences professor Alex Pentland said the new model of research is giving allowing greater insight into the complexities of life, and South Australia was a good fit for the project.
"We identified Adelaide early on as the prime location for a Living Lab in Australia and the broader region due to its leadership in data analytics and machine learning," he said.
The Lot Fourteen innovation precinct, on the site of the old Royal Adelaide Hospital, will host the headquarters of the Australian Space Agency and other cultural attractions, tech businesses and education facilities.
