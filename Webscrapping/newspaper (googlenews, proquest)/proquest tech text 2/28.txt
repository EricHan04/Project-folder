Renew Adelaide has appointed Gianna Murphy as its new chief executive. Ms Murphy will replace outgoing boss Andrew White, who is stepping down to take on a new position as executive manager of Rundle Mall.
Ms Murphy is currently head of property and operations at Renew Adelaide, which activates vacant CBD spaces by facilitating short-term, rent-free leases between landlords and creative start-ups.
She has been with the non-profit organisation since 2016, and said her appointment coincided with record interest in the program.
Renew Adelaide has more than 380 new concepts waiting for spaces in the CBD, and the organisation is seeking new funding partnerships to facilitate more activations.
“With six years’ experience in the organisation, I am confident in Renew Adelaide’s strength to continue delivering on activations that cater to the unique identity of each precinct, and am passionate about using that strength to enhance Adelaide’s overall visitor experience,” Ms Murphy said.
Mr White will start in his new position, within Adelaide City Council’s Adelaide Economic Development Agency (AEDA), on May 19, after signing off at Renew Adelaide and at Maras Group where he has held an ongoing leasing role.
AEDA is the sole financial supporter of Renew Adelaide activities. Renew Adelaide chairman Nick Begakis said the organisation had launched 35 new ventures since the start of Covid-19, with more than 15 graduating from the program to commercial leases.
He said Ms Murphy’s contributions during that period held her in good stead to take on the leadership role. “Gianna’s extensive network and relationships within the start-up and entrepreneurial community will be instrumental as we continue to create compelling and exciting new CBD ventures, which attract new visitors and create new jobs,” Mr Begakis said.
