PERKS Private Wealth has appointed Christo Hall as the new chairman of its investment committee.
Mr Hall, who will join Perks at the start of May, has more than 30 years’ experience in senior roles with organisations including BlackRock and Argo Investments.
He is currently the chief investment officer at Ellerston Capital, which has more than $4bn in funds under management.
Head of Perks Private Wealth Simon Hele said the appointment reinforced the firm’s commitment to building its investment research capabilities and continuing to enhance its innovation in investment strategies.
“We’ve been in the market for an investment committee chair of Christo’s calibre for nearly two years, so securing his services represents a key strategic step for Perks Private Wealth,” he said.
“With over $1bn in funds under management, our firm continues its strong growth trajectory over the past 24 months, underpinned by the appointment of a head of investment research and acquisition of local advisory firm Wotherspoon Wealth.” Mr Hall said he hoped to leverage his experiences in Australia and abroad to help expand the investment opportunities available to Perks clients.
“Over the course of my career, I’ve had exposure to a wide range of markets and investment opportunities beyond typical asset classes, such as equity markets and property,” he said. “Ultimately, my ambition is to help Perks Private Wealth continue to expand its depth and breadth of wealth advice by helping open doors to a wider range of investment opportunities, whether that be in private equity, co-investing or even start-up funding.”
