BORIS Johnson has been ordered to face court over claims he lied about the European Union’s cost to the British economy.
A court ruled yesterday that the UK prime minister contender should answer a private prosecution from a political rival over his statements during a campaign about whether Britain should leave the European Union in 2016.
Mr Johnson claimed that leaving the bloc would save the UK £350 million ($A638 million) per week.
A source close to Mr Johnson, pictured, said the prosecution was “nothing less than a politically motivated attempt to reverse Brexit and crush the will of the people”.
Pro-European Union campaigner Marcus Ball pursued the prosecution, crowd funding £200,000 ($A364m) to pay for legal fees.
Lawyers representing Mr Ball lodged an application to summons Mr Johnson to court, claiming he had deliberately misled the public during the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, and then repeated the statement during the 2017 general election.
In a written decision, District Judge Margot Coleman said: “The allegations which have been made are unproven accusations and I do not make any findings of fact.
“Having considered all the relevant factors I am satisfied that this is a proper case to issue the summons as requested for the three offences as drafted. The charges are indictable only. The charges can only be dealt with in the Crown Court.”No date was set for the hearing. The case carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
