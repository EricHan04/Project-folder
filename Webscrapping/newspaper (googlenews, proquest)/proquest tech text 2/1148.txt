From massage guns to artificially intelligent personal trainers, fitness gadgets have come a long way CORE LOGIC Peloton Guide It’s not all about the bike; Peloton’s Guide goes for strength $445, onepeloton.com.au PROS Huge range of strength workouts On-screen guidance, metrics Discreet TV gadget CONS High outright price $35/m ongoing subscription Basic body tracking Naturally, Peloton is best known for exercise bikes but its Guide device is something totally different. The fitness gadget plugs into a user’s TV and features a camera that uses artificial intelligence to track a user’s movements. Users can choose from a huge selection of strength workouts to use with the device, focusing on everything from their core to lower body, and the device will show their image on screen alongside the instructor for reference. The Guide does require an ongoing Peloton subscription, however, but it will provide detail of the muscle groups you work as well as personalised recommendations.

ODD BUT IT WORKS RecoveryAir Pro One of the most unusual ways to recover from a workout $1829, therabody.com PROS Reduces muscle soreness Boosts recovery time Customised with an app CONS High cost Large device Specific use Hikers, cyclists, joggers, martial artists and tennis players pay attention: this intense exercise gadget could get you ready for your next sporting feat quicker. Therabody’s RecoveryAir Pro has to be one of the wackiest sporting gadgets on the market but it’s well designed, solidly built, and effective. Two boots zip over your legs and, when hooked up to its control unit, blow up with pneumatic compression to increase the circulation in your legs from your feet up. Each cycle can be customised in an app by pressure chambers and five guided treatment programs are available.

Theragun Pro This top-of-the-line smart massage gun earns its title $899, therabody.com PROS Powerful massaging device Useful guided exercises Full accessory kit CONS Expensive pro model Makes some noise Heavy for travel Theragun has developed a cult following for its triangular muscle massagers and this Pro model, at the top of the range, demonstrates why. The fourth version of this device features a powerful motor with 27.2kg of force, five power levels, an adjustable arm and a 2.5-hour battery life. It also smoothly connects to an app where users can choose warm-up or recovery routines that automatically sync to the machine. Given its power, it does make noise (though not as much as you’d expect) and it weighs 1.3kg.

COMFY & SNUG Jabra Elite 4 Active Small, sporty earbuds that won’t fly out as you jump and spin $179, jabra.com.au PROS Comfortable, small design Noise-cancellation and pass-through Advanced water-resistance CONS Buttons are impractical No control customisation Must download app Jabra’s new earbuds are designed for sport and you can tell. The small Elite 4 Active earbuds sit surprisingly snugly and won’t move when you do. They’re also sweat and water-resistant, feature active noise-cancellation technology and pass-through sound for exercising outdoors. Users must download an app to unlock some features, including equaliser settings. Button controls are uncomfortable to use and you can’t change controls but the sporty sound machines are uncommonly comfy. ***1/2
