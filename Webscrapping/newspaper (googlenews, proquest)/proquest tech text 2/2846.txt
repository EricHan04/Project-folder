Known for its racy content and gaining popularity during coronavirus lockdowns, OnlyFans said on Friday it would still permit nudity within its “acceptable use policy” but would ban “sexually explicit” content from October.
Adelaide OnlyFans creators said the changes were unfair to sex workers and would only drive users elsewhere.
Adelaide’s Milly Onaire, 21, said the new policy was an “attack on the sex industry”.
“I find it discriminatory and in my personal opinion, a poor business decision on their end as pornography is where majority of OnlyFans business comes from,” she said.
“It won’t stop creators, it will only move them to another platform.
“OnlyFans is currently my main income and was my only income for a long time.
“I wouldn’t have gotten through Covid this far without it, so potentially losing my income as well as my profile … is stressful.”
Dolly Diamond has been a creator on OnlyFans since 2018. She said she was sceptical about the announcement until the site’s “acceptable use policy” was clarified.
“For now it’s fake news. I don’t do porn so it does not impact me at all … (but) I can’t see it happening in the way it’s been put across,” said Diamond, who moved to Australia from England about seven years ago.
Diamond, 29, said other online platforms such as Tumblr and crowd-funding website Patreon had previously banned sexually explicit content but creators found new avenues to share their content.
“When one platforms falls another will be in its place. Sex workers are unfortunately blasted like this so often,” said Ms Diamond, who is ranked in the top three per cent of OnlyFans creators.
“It happened on Tumblr then Patreon. Sex workers are used up then chucked out.”
Another creator, Kiki Isobel, 24, of Adelaide, said she was also unsure if the proposed changes to OnlyFans were accurate.
“I’ve seen heaps of articles about this but I also have friends who messaged OnlyFans first hand and they’ve denied it. So it’s hard to tell at this point what’s true or not,” said Isobel, who’s been creating content since July last year.
An OnlyFans statement said the changes were being made in response to concerns from its bankers and investors, as it seeks to broaden its audience beyond adult content.
Starting October 1, “OnlyFans will prohibit the posting of any content containing sexually explicit conduct,” a statement said.
“Creators will continue to be allowed to post content containing nudity as long as it is consistent with our acceptable use policy.”
The statement did not offer specifics on what OnlyFans will consider sexually explicit content.
OnlyFans, which has been a favourite of porn stars seeking to earn money from performances, gained popularity during the pandemic, as sex workers connected with customers online.
But OnlyFans recently launched a “suitable for work” channel offering videos of fitness, music and cooking, competing with platforms such as Facebook that allow creators to earn money.
