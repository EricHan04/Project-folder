Two new agtech start-up hubs will open, one in the South East and one on the Eyre Peninsula.
Primary Industries and Regional Development Minister David Basham announced the start-up hubs at the conference.
"The hubs are very much about letting farmers have access to people developing new ideas and those developing new ideas having access to farmers so they can actually fine-tune their production to make it commercially viable and extendable," Mr Basham said.
"It's about bringing all the parties together so the conversations can occur to achieve better outcomes.
"We know that increasing the use of agtech on-farm and throughout the supply chain will be a boom for the whole state with our farmers growing more food and profitability.
"Agtech enables agribusiness to innovate, grow and adopt more efficient practices."
The South East start-up hub will involve agtech which supports livestock and grazing systems.
While the Eyre Peninsula start-up hub will support broad-acre cropping and sheep production systems.
The agtech start up hubs, which will be supported by BDO Advisory's agtech division and Hydra Consulting, will nurture concepts, testing and adoption by farmers.
Expressions of interest are now being sought from agtech entrepreneurs who would like assistance to develop and commercialise their ideas.
