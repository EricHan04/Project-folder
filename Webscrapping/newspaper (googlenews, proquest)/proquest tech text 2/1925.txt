Career paths to extend beyond meatwork skills THE Thomas Foods International abattoir rebuild at Murray Bridge will be unprecedented, according to chief executive officer Darren Thomas.
"There will be nothing undertaken of this scale in the world," he said.
"We are investing many hundreds of millions of dollars in the new multi-species plant and it will feature the very latest in technology."
Before fire devastated the former plant in January 2018, TFI was processing up to 4500 cattle a week and 120,000 sheep and lambs - making the company the largest small stock processor in Australia.
Mr Thomas said the new facility would aim to process 30 per cent more small stock and 30-40pc more cattle.
The self-proclaimed "parochial South Australian" said the company also wanted to create an "attractive" work environment.
"In the past, it has been incredibly hard to get labour," he said.
"This new facility is not just a meatworks anymore, it's a food processing plant and some of things we are doing now are not the usual meatworks jobs.
"We are going to need programmers, people with artificial intelligence and computer sciences experience.
"Will we also place a big emphasis on training.
"Because of TFI's global networks, we can offer an incredible career path, particularly with this new state-of-the-art processing facility."
