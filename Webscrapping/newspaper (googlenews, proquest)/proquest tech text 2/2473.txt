Helping older Australians enjoy life to the fullest is the aim of a new online platform bursting with ideas, tools and guidance to support seniors to stay healthy, maintain independence, make connections and have fun. Created with funding from the federal government, LiveUp features a screening tool with expert advice connecting older Australians to local services, support networks and assistive products and equipment to help them age their way. The free platform is designed to support early intervention and delay premature decline of an older person’s capacity to live or function independently. “The science shows that only 25 per cent of ageing is attributed to the genes we inherit: The remaining 75 per cent of ageing can be attributed to lifestyle choices we make,” iLA general manager Andrea Morris says. “That’s why LiveUp is designed to give people a breadth of opportunities to maintain or even improve their independence and add life to years, not just years to life.” After completing a simple online quiz to assess their abilities and interests, users can receive curated advice about local events and activities, tips for staying healthy and low-cost assistive technology to support the activities of daily living. “People can find locally relevant services and networks so they can stay supported and connected,” Morris says. “In simple terms, it creates a personal roadmap to take control of ageing. And that’s whether someone is starting to feel a twinge or two or is a great-grandparent who could use aids and equipment to support their day-to-day tasks at home or in the community.” The platform is expected to grow and develop as more resources are added to help people with their healthy ageing journey. “By understanding how to take control of many of the changes that occur from ageing, older Australians can take action and enjoy a better quality of life,” Morris says. “We all hold the key to ageing in our own hands and minds.” liveup.org.au
