IN A first for global aviation, Australia’s new low-cost carrier Bonza has announced its commitment to serve exclusively Australian food and drinks on board.
The airline’s on-board menu will consist of 100 per cent Australian snacks, meals and beverages.
Bonza chief commercial officer Carly Povey said there would be no option for popular global international soft drink or chip brands. Bonza is yet to announce a start-up date but has announced plans to initially fly to 25 destinations in 2022.
