STREET parties, a 24-hour shopping event, lowering property rates and free night-time parking are among ideas to revitalise the CBD post COVID-19.
Adelaide City councillors and Lord Mayor Sandy Verschoor, pictured, were asked to share their suggestions to attract visitors into the city, to help businesses recover from the financial impact of the pandemic.
Ms Verschoor said she would push the council to start up “Magical Musical Mystery Tours”, in which small groups were taken to unusual places around the city, like alleyways and rooftops, and treated to music, food and wine. “We are a creative city, and now, more than ever, we need to get creative (and find) ways to welcome everyone back,” Ms Verschoor said.
Deputy Lord Mayor Alexander Hyde proposed lowering residential and business rates to help the city recover. “It is going to help businesses re-open … residents invest in their homes and ease the cost of living,” Cr Hyde said.
Some elected members were to raise their ideas at last night’s meeting. Cr Phillip Martin wants increased outdoor dining space for restaurants and cafes, and Cr Mary Couros was to ask for an investigation into holding more events, to showcase the state’s food, wine, fashion and sport.Cr Simon Hou said he wanted free night-time parking after 5pm to stimulate the local economy.
