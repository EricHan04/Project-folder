International travel may be possible this year as the Pfizer vaccine begins bolstering the country's defences to COVID-19.
As dozens of flight crew and other airport workers joined the first Victorians to become vaccinated against coronavirus at Melbourne Airport yesterday, experts said unrestricted travel to and from select countries could return within months. Air New Zealand will ask passengers to use a digital health pass on flights to Australia in April, in a trial run of a "vaccine passport" system, giving a glimpse of what international travel will look like until the coronavirus is no longer a threat.
University of South Australia epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said he expected vaccine passports would be developed by the year's end.
