The MS11 canola was developed by Bayer CropScience as a genetically modified variety with tolerance to glufosinate herbicides. The OGTR said the canola variety could be used in human food and animal feed. It said the risk assessment and risk management plan concluded “that this commercial release poses negligible risk to people and the environment”.
