THE NT government will make no contribution to the new $700m subsea optical cable system which will deliver investment and jobs to the Territory.
A spokesperson for Chief Minister Michael Gunner said late Friday the government would contribute “nothing” to the Asia Connect Cable (ACC-1), which the NT News revealed exclusively on Thursday.
The cable will link Singapore, Indonesia, East Timor, Australia and the west coast of the US with Guam, with connections in Japan.
Melbourne start-up Inligo Network plan to land the Australian component of the cable at a location in Fannie Bay identified between Darwin High School and the Ski Club. Inligo Networks will also build a new $200m terrestrial cable linking Darwin to Adelaide.
Comments posted on social media responding to the NT News report questioned the Territory government’s contribution to getting the project into Darwin.
“History tells it will be … at a cost to the NT tax payer”, one reader contributed.
“How much did he waste this time?” another asked.
Simon Zettl, Inligo Networks commercial director, said the cable construction would have far-ranging benefits for the Territory economy.
“The opportunity to land a new international subsea cable into Darwin creates the connectivity and optionality required by today’s technology providers and will underpin significant additional investments into Darwin,” he said. Inligo Networks estimates the cable will be operational by 2025.
