THE total length of Australia’s vineyards could wrap the earth 11 times, according to the first National Vineyard Scan.
Funded by Wine Australia, the scan found the total area of vineyards in Australia was 146,128ha and the total length of vine rows was 463,718km.
The scan used artificial intelligence and satellite imagery and has replaced the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ paper-based sector survey, last published in 2015.
For the first time it showed the nation’s biggest winegrape region was the Riverland and the smallest was Hastings River in NSW.
It showed the Barossa Valley was up 1560ha and the Riverina down by 2112ha, when compared to the 2015 ABS survey.
The Murray-Darling was also down 942ha.
Wine Australia chief executive Andreas Clark said the last ABS survey put the total reported area of vineyards at 135,133ha, about 8 per cent less than the vineyard scan found.
“But because of the differences in the methods used it is unwise to assign all of that difference to growth in plantings,” Mr Clark said.
“Some of that difference is likely to be the difference between estimated returns in the survey and actual mapping.” Mr Clark said the results of the scan and the comparison with the old survey supported anecdotal reports that there had been little change in the overall national vineyard size over the past few years.
“If all of the difference between the two figures were to be taken into account, it would suggest growth of 11,000ha nationally in three years or about 4 per cent average annual growth per year,” he said.“This aligns with anecdotal reports of only very moderate increases in plantings over that time frame.” With the locations of all vineyard blocks now mapped out, the information can be used for emergency biosecurity responses.
