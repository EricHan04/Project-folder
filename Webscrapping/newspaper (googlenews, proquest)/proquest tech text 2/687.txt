FOOTWEAR retailer Accent Group is gearing up to expand its retail store footprint by ­almost 20 per cent this year and launch a new workwear brand orientated towards women as the economy ­recovers amid a boom in consumer spending.
In an investor presentation yesterday the $1.2bn retailer group’s chief executive Daniel Agostinelli outlined plans to open 90 new retail stores by the end of the financial year, bringing the company’s total to 609.
A total of 50 of these planned stores are already trading.
Three of the planned stores will be dedicated to new workwear brand “4 Workers” and will be situated in ­shopping centres with a “store design orientated to appeal to women”. The company said the first store will open in May and carry workwear catered to “a broad customer base including nurses, chefs, tradies and ­others who work”.
Accent, which also owns brands including Hype, Vans and Athlete’s Foot, will also dedicate four new stores to Stylerunner, a street and sportswear “start-up” brand.
Accent’s expansion comes after it handed down a record half-year profit of $52.8m in February, driven by a boom in consumer spending.
Despite Accent’s significant investment in brick-and-mortar stores, the company also told shareholders that online sales have continued to boom in the second half of the financial year, after rising 110 per cent to $108.1m in the first half.
Digital general manager Kasie Heathcote said in the first eight weeks of the second half, online sales were up 65.4 per cent on the comparable period, comprising 17 per cent of all sales. Shares in Accent Group closed at $2.35, up 1.73 per cent.
