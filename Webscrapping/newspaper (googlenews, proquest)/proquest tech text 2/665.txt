THE state’s new chief entrepreneur expects the South Australian economy to quickly bounce back from COVID-19, backed by a new wave of innovators and entrepreneurs.
Environmental consultant Andrew Nunn, pictured, took over from inaugural chief entrepreneur Jim Whalley last week, 2½ years after the office was set up to support entrepreneurs and start-up businesses in SA.
He said the sector would play a key role in post-pandemic recovery. “There’s a lot of people that have returned to SA with some great ideas, with some financial support, and they’re back here for the beauty, the safety and the great lifestyle,” he said.
“But they’re also going to want to build their businesses; they’re going to want to take their opportunities here.
“I think we’ll pull out of COVID really well – there’s a really strong entrepreneurial spirit.” Since relocating from Melbourne to Adelaide in the late 1990s, Mr Nunn has developed his business, JBS&G, from a kitchen table operation into one of the country’s biggest privately owned environmental con­sulting companies.
He said he hoped to put his own stamp on the voluntary position. “I’d love to see people not so scared to make a mistake – we need to keep having a go and moving forward,” he said.
