THE granddaughter of Sir Donald Bradman, opera soprano Greta, is on the move in Melbourne’s up-market South Yarra after buying the former home of actor Madeleine West for $15 million. Bradman, who grew up in Adelaide using the family alias Bradsen until her father John reverted to Bradman in 1997 following the death of Jessie Bradman, is married to $2 billion software start-up executive Didier Elzinga. The property, set on 1250sqm, boasts four bedrooms, three bathrooms, cinema room, wine cellar, pool and gym and will also be home to the couple’s sons, Jude and Casper. The couple married in 2006 after being introduced in 2000 at the 21st birthday of mutual friend, Sydney PR boss Bec Brown. They made their fortune after Elzinga applied his wife’s interest in psychology, with software for the HR industry. “We founded it on an idea there’s decades of research in psychology, but it is not being applied. If we can make those ideas accessible, we can make a difference,” he said.
