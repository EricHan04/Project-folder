A needle that uses a miniscule camera to measure lamb intramuscular fat instantly could be commercialised within three years, if a team of South Australian scientists has their way.
A team of medical engineers and livestock researchers from the University of Adelaide, in collaboration with Meat & Livestock Australia and tech start-up Miniprobes, has been awarded a $1.5 million Commonwealth Government Cooperative Research Centre Projects grant to develop the device.
The IMF needle is a stainless-steel needle fitted with a tiny lens on the end of an optical fibre, which when inserted provides a high-resolution scan of the fat structure within muscle.
Its design is based on 10 years of research and development from the University of Adelaide and University of Western Australia. Lead researcher Robert McLaughlin said the technology was originally intended for identifying human cancer cells.
After a conversation with MLA two years ago, it became clear it could have big implications in the burgeoning lamb IMF measurement sector. The next year will be focused on R&D, followed by two years creating a product that can work at speed and doing extensive trials.
