NEWCOMER Betr has joined Australia’s ultra-competitive $6.4bn wagering market. The bookmaking firm will launch on Wednesday ahead of next weekend’s huge Caulfield Cup and Everest race meetings.
Betr, headed by wagering mogul Matt Tripp and chief executive Andrew Menz, is backed by an ownership group including News Corp Australia and Las Vegas-based Tekkorp Capital, and is powered by Betmakers Technology Group.
Mr Menz said the start-up entered the evolving market with ambitious objectives. “We make no secret that our ambition is to grow market share rapidly in what’s an extremely competitive market,” he said. “And we’ll achieve that by putting the customer at the forefront of everything we do with the offering of compelling products and competitive odds.
“The brand we are building is one that stands for the punter. Racing is an industry but at heart it’s a sport and we want to celebrate the broader racing community and the great stories it generates.” Mr Menz said the start-up would offer a Melbourne Cup special deal for new customers.
“We will be offering $101 about every runner in the Cup right through until Victoria Derby day,” he said.
“It will be capped at $10 (bets) but what better way to announce your arrival into the market than by offering such a great market on our most famous race.
“And for the business it’s ­really symbolic that we are launching the week of The ­Everest, which has really resonated with the under-35 sports fan that enjoys a punt and a good time.” To succeed in the ­wagering ecosystem, Mr Menz said it would be important to focus on brand, product and promotions. “Your product, promotions and brand are critical,” he said. “I’m hugely excited about our racing products and love the way we’ve been able to ­integrate content and tips, and bring the punter along on the journey.”
