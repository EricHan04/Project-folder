QANTAS bosses believe their first customer trial of a digital health passport on a flight from Germany is a huge step forward in getting Australians travelling internationally again.
Passengers on board flight QF116, which landed in Darwin from Frankfurt on Thursday, were the first to trial the CommonPass digital health app. The smartphone app will show COVID-19 test results and will include proof of vaccination.
Designed by Swiss-based company Commons Project Foundation, the app connects customers to certified testing labs so results can be uploaded to their phone.
CommonPass displays the origin of vaccination records to ensure it covers the health screening requirements of a country they want to enter.
CommonPass delivers a simple “yes” or “no” answer as to whether the individual meets the current entry criteria. Passengers can show border officials proof of a negative COVID-19 test result before their flight.
Qantas successfuly trialled CommonPass with flight crew in February and said digital vaccine passports would help its quest to resume international travel by late October. “We want to get our international flights back in the air and our people back to work, a,” Qantas chief customer officer Stephanie Tully said.
