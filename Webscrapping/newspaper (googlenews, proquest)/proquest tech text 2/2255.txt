Nothing lasts forever. Right now Adelaide has Australia’s best payback times for solar and battery, thanks to generous subsidies offered by government authorities, energy providers and other industry heavyweights.
But the success of these subsidies, which has seen our state become a world leader in renewables, will see a scaling back of incentives this year. Some will even end. So South Australians are in a critical moment, where indecision could be costly.
Your house is the biggest investment you will make in your lifetime. It’s been proved that adding solar and other renewable technology adds value and makes it easier to sell. Including smart technology to run and monitor these systems gives another big tick on the list of features for savvy buyers.
Everyone involved in the real estate market knows a lot more about renewable energy than they did even five years ago. This is because the momentum of both the industry producing renewables and the energy market it supplies has overtaken a decade of Federal Government policy blundering and indecision. You only have to do an internet map search of your suburb to see how many households have solar. It’s become one of the safest investments a homeowner can make. But, as I said before, nothing lasts forever.
Several other factors also make it imperative for people to stop dithering when it comes to renewables. One is the expected disruption of coronavirus to the international solar industry supply chain. Another is the fact that the number of allocated places in the top Virtual Power Plant schemes are filling up. VPPs are networks of home solar and battery systems combining to generate, store and feed electricity into the grid. Joining a VPP is the best way to maximise income from battery storage.So that’s my call to arms for this week. Please call me if you want to discuss anything further.
