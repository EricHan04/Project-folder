TECHNOLOGY FINTECH disrupter Till Payments is on track to join local success stories Afterpay and Airwallex and become a billion-dollar tech company as it embarks on a global expansion.
The start-up, founded by CEO Shadi Haddad, is taking on the banks with its single-source solutions that allow merchants to accept any payment wherever and whenever their customers shop.
Till has now raised $110m in Series C funding from new and existing investors based in Australia and the US, including Avenir Growth, Woodson Capital, and Akuna Capital.
Mr Haddad – who funded the company himself in its early days – said Till has 125 staff and is looking to double its headcount in the next 12 months. “Till was born out of the idea that merchants aren’t all one size, and they need simple and seamless solutions, in what is a complex payment ecosystem that has largely been formed by the banks and the legacy systems that they’re encumbered with,” he said. Till was formed in 2012 and its technology is now in about 500 cities globally.
