CRYPTO assets are poised to enter the mainstream financial system, with Commonwealth Bank becoming the nation’s first retail bank to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly through the CommBank app.
CBA has partnered with one of the world’s largest regulated crypto exchanges and custodians, Gemini, and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The partnerships have enabled the bank to design a crypto exchange and custody service that will be offered to customers through a new feature in the app, with a pilot to start in the coming weeks and a rollout to more customers in 2022.
CBA will provide customers with access to up to 10 selected crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, but has tried to rebut concerns about the potential for fraud and security breaches by creating a closed-loop system to prevent wallet-to-wallet transfers from other exchanges. “That allows us to control the customer onboarding and KYC (know your customer anti-money laundering rules),” chief executive Matt Comyn (pictured) said. “So we’ve proposed a lower-risk model to Austrac.” While estimates vary, Mr Comyn said about 8 per cent of the Australian population currently invested in crypto – a figure which had grown rapidly over the last 12 months.
