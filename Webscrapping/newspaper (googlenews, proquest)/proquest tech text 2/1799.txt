THE rise of artificial intelligence and increased workforce automation could bring on a winner-takes-all effect across society and accelerate inequality, says a senior member of a think tank founded by multi-billionaire George Soros. Lord Adair Turner, chairman of Britain’s Energy Transitions Commission and research fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, told a Creative Innovation conference in Melbourne yesterday that the rise of FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google) stocks, had led to enormous wealth accrued by a few people who created the software machinery “that runs much of the world”.
“This winner-takes-all effect will not just apply in artificial intelligence, but in the high touch world of celebrity, sporting, fashion and design prowess,” he said.
Australian business leaders have warned that the rate at which robots replace humans would spark an employment crisis and have urged governments to confront the issue.
Lord Turner said wages would be depressed for less skilled workers in the AI age.
“Their jobs will be automated or their wages will remain low enough because their jobs are not worth automating,” he said.– THE AUSTRALIAN
