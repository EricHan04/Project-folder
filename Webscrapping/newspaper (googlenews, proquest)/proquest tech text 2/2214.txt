THE rest of Australia will return to “normal” time when daylight saving ends this weekend.
South Australia, Victoria, NSW, the ACT and Tasmania residents should have set their clocks back an hour before going to bed last night, rejoining the Territory, Queensland and Western Australia that opt to keep standard time over summer.
Smartphones and digital devices synched with time zones should have adjusted automatically, but old-school gadgets or those without smart technology needed to be changed manually.
Daylight saving has been a feature of life since at least 1971, with Australia split into five time zones instead of the usual three.
WA has trialled daylight saving numerous times and held four referendums on the issue, the most recent in 2009 when voters rejected the concept.
Queensland trialled daylight saving in the 1970s and for three years from 1989, ending with a referendum in 1992 when the proposal was again rejected. The NT has not trialled daylight saving since World War II, and the prospect does not appear to have generated much interest here.
