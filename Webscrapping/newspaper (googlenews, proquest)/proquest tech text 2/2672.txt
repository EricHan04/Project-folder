QUEENSLAND-based national IT services company Dialog has bought SA digital business Innodev and its 70 staff consultants.
Innodev helps state government departments in SA, Victoria and Queensland, and defence companies, universities and utilities with technology architecture, digital risk management and data analytics.
The deal is the end of Innodev founder Tim Browne’s journey towards building his own “tribe” since 2007. In a blog post on Innodev’s website, Mr Browne revealed he had been approached by Alan Key and Bob Tisdall, co-owners of Dialog, to discuss the takeover.
He will continue with Dialog, which has more than 1200 staff as regional director SA. “Being part of the Dialog group tangibly expands our knowledge and experience, provides access to new opportunities...,” Mr Browne said.
