TESLA chairwoman Robyn Denholm will address the Southstart Emergence start-up festival in Adelaide in May, with the event also holding a showcase of new companies.
Ms Denholm, who was chief operations officer and then chief financial officer at Telstra before stepping down to take up the role at Elon Musk’s electric car company, will speak alongside Start­upAus chief executive Alex McCauley, Australian Space Agency chief technical officer Aude Vignelles and Sage Automation chief executive Adrian Fahey.
The festival – from May 3-6 – will also include a start-up ecosystem summit. Event director Craig Swann said the start-up showcase would enable up-and-coming companies to pitch at a live event to more than 30 general partners from Australia’s leading venture capital firms.
He said the Southstart team, which had been running virtual events last year, was looking forward to getting people together physically.
“While virtual events have been our focus – and a necessity – for the past year, Southstart, at its heart, has always been about human-first experiences,” Mr Swann said.
“With state borders open and the COVID-19 vaccine currently being rolled out, this year will see many dinners, parties and real-life conversations taking place – those moments for organic connection and a chance to unlock unexpected knowledge and networks that can only happen face-to-face.
“We will hear from the voices we need to hear and explore the pressing questions and opportunities for Australia and beyond.” Minister for Innovation and Skills David Pisoni said the government-supported festival was integral to creating new opportunities for South Australians.
