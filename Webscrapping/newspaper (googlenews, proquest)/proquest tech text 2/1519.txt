UBER ride-sharing matches customers to the nearest driver and now the US wants Australia to be integrated into a sophisticated defence shield that matches the most appropriate missiles to the closest targets.
It is understood principles of the JADC2 defence strategy are being studied at the Talisman Sabre 2021 military exercise in Queensland and NSW.
Talisman 2021 is the biennial war games for the US and Australian militaries, and other partners, including Japan, and are seen as critical for the compatibility of these countries’ military systems.
The US military high command confirmed important allies were brought into the JADC2 strategy as it was being built, rather than have Five Eyes partners Australia, the UK, Canada, New Zealand and others “bolted on” to it later.
The US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, General Mark Milley, pictured, singled out China as the “pacing threat” in the region for which a war-avoiding strong deterrence was required. In its designing of JADC2, a “next-generation, multi-domain command-and-control vision”, the US Defence has cited Uber as the unlikely example.
The ride-share company pulls together reams of disparate data and uses artificial intelligence, machine-learning algorithms and two different apps to quickly and efficiently match the right drivers on one app with the right passengers on the other.
JADC2 would allow a target to be seen from an airforce drone sensor integrated into naval or land forces to attack a target or respond to a threat, with all land, sea, air and space military assets operating and speaking with each other on the same platform. “We’re never going to fight alone, we’re going to fight with partners, so JADC2 has got to mean the same thing to them as it does to us,” said Lieutenant General Dennis Crall, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff director of command, control, communications and computers.
