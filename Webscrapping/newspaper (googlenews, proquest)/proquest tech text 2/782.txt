START-UPS PRESCRIPTION drugs are the latest items to be delivered via the gig economy as it matures from fulfilling late-night hamburger orders and ride-sharing, to ensuring medications arrive on the doorstep — even at weekends.
Melbourne-based start-up Medmate is preparing to launch in its home city and plans to expand into Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide after running a successful pilot program and three years of planning.
The business — led by GP Ganesh Naidoo and pharmacist Wael Hanna — has partnered with food delivery giant DoorDash to perform 24/7 door-to-door deliveries of pharmaceuticals.
Dr Naidoo developed the concept after his mother and some of his patients experienced difficulties fulfilling their medication requirements and encountered a non-adherent rate as high as 50 per cent.
He said Medmate would make “fulfilling prescription medications as simple as ordering a meal from Uber Eats”.
Processing medications electronically would occur within 60 minutes. Dr Naidoo said there were several reasons for a patient to not adhere to the full course of their medications but the main one was logistics.
“They simply find it too inconvenient, they forget and they run out,” he said. “We thought there was a (need for a) simpler way for people to access their medications when they need them.”
