A 50-YEAR-OLD documentary on the establishment of Canberra’s Aboriginal Tent Embassy – almost lost forever – has been fully restored and will screen in Adelaide.
NINGLA-ANA, which tells the story of the first activists to travel from Redfern to Canberra to protest for Indigenous land rights, has been revived thanks to the help of a Hollywood heavyweight.
“NINGLA-ANA was on the point of collapse,” Haydn Keenan, the filmmaker who supervised the restoration, said. “We decided to give crowd funding a go. Within 10 days we’d raised all the money we needed, including a generous swag from one Russell Crowe.” Originally shown on tiny screens with audiences seated in bean bags, the film is now rolling out nationally through Dendy, Wallis and Nova cinemas.
The film opens on September 29 at Wallis Mitcham, followed by Port Augusta, Victor Harbor and Kadina. SA Attorney-General Kyam Maher will attend the opening and will speak along with Indigenous actor Natasha Wanganeen.
