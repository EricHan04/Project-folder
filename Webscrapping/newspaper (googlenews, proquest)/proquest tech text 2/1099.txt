FIRST it was autonomous vehicles, then it was Snowy Hydro robot dogs, now it’s time for a new piece of futuristic tech to hit our shores.
Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles has officially launched a new supercomputer program which is up to a million times faster than a standard computer.
The state-of-the-art tech, the first of its kind in Australia, will enable Defence scientists to analyse large data sets and rapidly perform complex calculations to tackle some of the trickiest scientific and engineering problems.
Expected to play a role in the design, development and analysis of modern weapon systems and national security systems, the new gadget is set to boost our ability to develop key AUKUS priorities, including nuclear-powered submarines, quantum technologies and artificial intelligence.
“For much of the work done by our Defence scientists, data is critical,” Mr Marles said.
“But even more important than the data itself is the ability to rapidly and reliably analyse and process that data.
“This high-performance computing facility provides a secure and sovereign capability to do just that.” The advanced new powers will be used at the Defence Science and Technology Group site at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct in South Australia.
The new computing infrastructure is known as Taingiwilta, meaning “powerful” in the language of the Kaurna people – the First Nations people of Adelaide. It is housed in a purpose-built secure facility called Mukarntu, meaning “computer”.
