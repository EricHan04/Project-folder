YEAR OF THE WOMAN ELOISE Hall, 20, and Isobel Marshall, 21, were completing high school studies in 2016 when a leadership conference set the friends on a path to cause-driven entrepreneurship.
They were inspired to establish a business that enabled the everyday purchases of Australians to improve the lives of people around the world.
TABOO was established in 2017 and raised more than $50,000 in 2018 through a crowd-funding effort that was supported by family and friends. The funding helped produce their social enterprise’s first sanitary pads - a step which the founders hope is just the start of their journey to improve the lives of girls and women around the world.
All profits from sales are committed to Victorian charity organisation One Girl, which helps disadvantaged girls and women, especially in Africa.
Half of all Australians will need sanitary products for a large part of their lives, and they usually need to purchase them every month. Australians spend more than $300 million on sanitary products annually.
The TABOO sanitary pad and tampon packs are sold online and through a single IGA store at Malvern.
TABOO is currently breaking even, and will start distributing profits to One Girl once they are in the black.
“We are hoping to scale up by talking to more retailers and investors,” Ms Marshall said. “We have drawn a lot of energy and support from our peers and people around Australia that we haven’t even met,” Ms Hall said.
“At TABOO, we are a team of 8 volunteers driving this, so we hope to scale up enough to be able to be more impactful for our chosen charity,” Ms Hall said.
Other plans include moving into an expanded range of menstrual hygiene products, but that’s in the future.For now, the busy entrepreneurs are also undertaking university degrees – Ms Marshall is studying medicine at the University of Adelaide while Ms Hall is pursuing business and international studies at the Flinders University.
