AN ADELAIDE sports drink start-up is targeting America’s 30 million Strava users as it prepares to launch into the US.
PREPD recently completed a US Strava challenge during the country’s marathon season, to boost the brand’s profile and gather market intelligence ahead of an expansion next year.
Close to 152,000 participants signed up to the challenge – to complete eight hours of exercise over a four-week period.
PREPD chief executive Andrew Perry said that with the market insights gathered from the challenge, and with the help of a recent one-for-one state government grant of $138,400, the company was ready for its US expansion.
“Something like 16.3 million people saw our product or had impressions on the Strava channels – in terms of getting in front of that many eyeballs it’s hard to do without using a global platform like Strava,” he said. “The most interesting engagement and purchases we got out of the US from the Strava challenge was from California, New York and Texas. It clearly articulates the markets we want to chase – we can target California, land in there and then expand through New York and Texas.
“Roughly 40 million people live in California and they certainly sit well above the national average in terms of activity levels, so we know it’s a great market for us.” PREPD will initially launch in the US via an e-commerce offering, but it is also in talks with sports dietitians who could open doors to elite athletes and professional sporting organisations. The product is a two-step hydration enhancer consumed six-12 hours before, and then after, exertion. It is designed to boost the absorption of electrolyte drinks or water.
