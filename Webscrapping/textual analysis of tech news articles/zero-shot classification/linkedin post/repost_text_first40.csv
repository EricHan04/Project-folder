Add-Life Technologies,2mo,2022-06-06,Glad to see Australian healthcare embracing AI and Telehealth to address stroke diagnosis and recovery. At #addlifetech we are hoping these technologies can help at every stage of the recovery process. #virtualreality #rehabilitation #digitaljourney,1,"In NSW about 18,000 people present with stroke symptoms each year. Typically a CT scan is required.There are 2 types of strokes - those caused by bleeds and those caused by clots.Treatment for clots usually means drugs. Quick administration can save lives/reduce severity of impact.However the challenge is diagnosis. There are only a handful of highly skilled people  - that can read the CT scan and tell the difference between clot/bleed and determine how much of the brain is recoverable.Telestroke enables the emergency physician to obtain urgent 24/7 advice to ascertain the type of stroke and the best treatment.Unsurprisingly - AI is also used to assist the specialists ascertain which parts of the brain are recoverable.üîπ Since it started, 360 - is the number of lives saved/enhanced as a result of Telestroke üôèTelehealth and virtual healthcare is an area that shows so much promise - to improve quality of life and reduce suffering üôè#digital #healthcare #digitaljourney",1

Artesian Capital Management,8mo,2022-06-06,none,4,"Excellent insights from my seasoned colleague, Gilles Plant√©, about getting #startup valuations just right on today's Decode (Innovation Ecosystem Analytics & Network) / LaunchVic webinar. Key takeaways:1. At the early stage, ability to execute & quality of team are crucial (e.g. ability to attract the right board, executive team and advisors)2. Other elements that influence valuations include:- industry, market and competition- competitive advantage- early traction (e.g. demonstration of product market fit) - paying customers- profitability- frequency of external capital infusion- brand reputation- business model- team (e.g. quality, background and credentials)3. Pitfalls: - pricing too low (resulting in heavy dilution & potential difficulty raising future rounds)- pricing too high (increased pressure, difficulty attracting quality talent due to value of options decreasing, potentially harder to raise/sell co. in the future)- accuracy of the numbers matters less than sound assumptions behind a model- unreasonable funding timelines and milestones4.

The output of this detailed analysis is usually a comprehensive report, Gallagher continued. ‚ÄúFor companies that make it through the negative screen, the next step is to carry out fundamental credit analysis including seeking out topical or ESG risks that are not priced in compared with other names within the same sector.‚Äù The final stage applies to labelled bonds only. Here, Artesian carries out comprehensive use-of-proceeds (UOP) analysis at security-by-security level.

Most retail businesses have some predictive capability but most investments in the next 5 -10 years are trending towards moving from prescriptive to autonomous stages.Georgie Uppington (Fresh Supply Co.) is witnessing a culture change that is sweeping through #farming and #agriculture sectors. Integrations with ERP decisions are becoming more mainstream and people are now able to integrate more quickly. In the future, this infrastructure push to go digital will become part of compliance.Rushabh Sanghavi (BROSA) is asking himself how to build a truly agile supply chain and would like to see a feedback loop covering a larger no. of stakeholders, even including trends around raw materials.

Aurrigo,1yr,2022-06-06,Want a deep dive into how we started and our future plans. Listen to the candid interview from our founder & CEO David Keene speaking to Andrew Grill and Engineers Australia#engineering #innovation #driverlessvehicles #australiangovernment,12,"One of the promises of 5G is ultra low latency. This is only possible if you put your content as close as possible to the end user. Vodafone has just launched a service with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wavelength to launch the first Multi-access Edge Computing services in the UK. One of the best uses cases of 5G low latency is autonomous vehicles. Today I had the pleasure of interviewing David Keene, the CEO of Aurrigo for a brand new webinar series for Engineers Australia.One of the topics we discussed was how Aurrigo has piloted an autonomous shuttle bus that runs between the park & ride and the¬†campus at Cambridge University, with Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) and 5G capabilities greatly improving safety and performance. This the door for more smart city use cases involving autonomous vehicles, as well as the ‚Äúmobility as a service‚Äù model.This is an excellent example of edge computing in action, and AWS servers will be placed right at the 5G cell-site.The webinar I hosted was part of a new thought leadership series from the UK Chapter of Engineers Australia to showcase innovative companies, products and processes to Australian and UK audiences.On the hour-long webinar, we also discussed‚Ä¢ The impact of the recent UK-Australia trade deal on international opportunities‚Ä¢ The war for talent‚Ä¢ The impact of Covid-19 on Engineers‚Ä¢ How Engineers are better able to adapt to challenges such as Covid‚Ä¢ The challenges of safety and autonomous vehicles‚Ä¢ The importance of critical and holistic thinking‚Ä¢ How autonomous vehicles can standardise wear and tear on roads‚Ä¢ The cybersecurity threats to vehiclesWatch a replay of the Engineers Australia UK webinar here https://lnkd.in/dHw3BTvRead the Vodafone AWS announcement here https://lnkd.in/denbWic#5G #vodafone #AWS #latency #autonomous #edgecomputing #autonomousvehicles #futurist #actionablefuturist",1

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,none,5,"ASA spends a great deal of time redeploying robots. We‚Äôve seen welding robots from old automotive assembly plants turned into palletising robots for the wine industry. The application scope for a redeployed robot is enormous. The key considerations before you buy are the payload of the robot (the weight it can it hold at the end of the arm), and the working envelope of the robot (how far it can reach). Other considerations are the age of the robot, which can impact the cost of the associated replacement parts, whether you‚Äôre trying to integrate the latest technology (such as force sensing) into the robot, and your application (whether you require an IP-67 rated, Foundry, or food grade robot).If you‚Äôre thinking about purchasing a second-hand robot, why not contact one of our team to organise a pre-purchase inspection? We can power the robot up, check for wear, and advise you of the configuration (reach/payload). If you‚Äôve got an application in mind, we can probably offer some industry insight on whether it‚Äôs the ideal robot for the task.

I was making GIFs & animation narratives using online bootlegs of Photoshop to tell stories because flat images didn't say enough. I did this so that I could make fan websites for tv shows & fictional couples I shipped. I was agonising over UX & UI when I coded my own version of social media profiles for my friends on angelfire & geocities long before friendster & bebo took off.I was a MySpace scene girl & optimised my page daily by creative directing colour palettes/images, curating music & copywriting comments/messages/announcements.I‚Äôm a Tumblr loyalist, who makes templates & moodboards. Whoever thinks Tumblr is dead isn‚Äôt a true community member because it‚Äôs still thriving with real fans & freaks like me.I optimise systems for myself across multiple apps/software/platforms.

I am an internet expert reduced to burner anon social media accounts because I have to hide my ability as it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúcorrect way to behave online‚Äù. I am a gamer in denial who shops for & designs virtual clothes in secret. I have been essentially living in the metaverse for decades, which is my true reality that I‚Äôve built on the internet.I am a woman in STEM who would never formally be recognised for it because my e-girl knowledge & experience doesn‚Äôt follow the textbook process & my style of technical skills but lack of formal qualification would be considered unprofessional. It takes me no time to learn a new platform/app/gameplay/language because I‚Äôve been actively immersed online since my first AOL 30-day free trial disc arrived in the mail as a tween. I love the internet so much that I got a ‚ÄúMom‚Äù heart tattoo in St Marks Place but requested the word ‚ÄúMom‚Äù be changed to ‚ÄúAOL‚Äù in commemoration of my e-birth mother.I am a public school princess from a low socio-economic neighbourhood & the first born child of migrant parents. Self-taught hacking was the only viable option. But I didn‚Äôt do it for a job or a career. I did it for creative expression. I did it for FREEDOM because I needed to find something online that was better than my reality.The DEI stats across STEM could be easily improved if the definition of inclusion in STEM didn‚Äôt rely on a portfolio of commercial or institutionally recognised work. Yet somehow we still ask why there isn‚Äôt enough diversity in STEM? Let‚Äôs start by asking the right questions & changing our recruitment tactics.

With a goal of becoming a future tech lead, Wei‚Äôs focused on becoming as technical as possible, and has already begun learning more on industrial coding style and the way to improve her code quality from our tech lead Andrew Ong.What we didn‚Äôt realise when we hired Wei was that we‚Äôd also be getting a package deal with her adorable chinchilla cat Kuku who likes to sit in on every meeting.Welcome aboard#aijourney2021 #codelikeagirl #machinelearning #aiatwork #deakinuniversity #universityofmelbourne",1

Check out our Eventbrite here: https://lnkd.in/dpMMhVGf",0,"""Decarbonisation. Digitalisation. Diversification"" The three D's quoted by Robert Daw, Chief Innovation Officer at Hexagon Mining to highlight the three major challenges facing the mining industry at the moment. We were fortunate to have Rob join us as our guest speaker at the launch of CORE Connect last night - a monthly conversation series aimed at exploring some of the big questions facing the mining, energy & resources sectors, and to hear from industry-leading players on solutions and pathways to create a greater and more sustainable future for the resources industry.We kicked off the event with some informal networking followed by a CORE Innovation Hub style speed networking session. I'm keen to know for those who attended - did you get to 'three'?Following this, we heard the case study presentation on Hexagon's partnership with Mineral Resources Limited and the successful implementation of the autonomous road train solution. One of the key learnings include the immense opportunities that could be realised for the sector through developing good partnerships - leveraging greater value, efficiencies and sustainable operations. Rob also touched on the importance of looking beyond today and not just to autonomous, but more importantly autonomy. There was a fantastic vibe to our launch event, and each individual brought a great amount of energy for the whole evening. I would have loved for more women in the resources sector to have been a part of this experience though - to have also contributed to the discussion and walked away with great insights and new contacts. I'm aware this is a recurring challenge, but I am interested to know your thoughts on why this might be the case? How can we as a collective do better? Feel free to DM me, as I do feel we all have a role to play when it comes to #diversity, and taking small steps is better than none at all. Thanks Kylah for the reminder.PS.

Good Empire,8mo,2022-06-06,An update from Andre on our crowdfund!,14,"Diary of an Equity CrowdfundDay T minus 1$457K from 559 ivestorsOkay, so our crowdfund round closes tomorrow, and we're closing in on our $500K target. Which is good.But it's been a looooooong valley of sadness!I won't transcribe this one, so feel free to watch the video for some insights - quite marketing-focused this time, with some metrics.If you'd like to invest, or know someone who might, here's a link: https://lnkd.in/g-DVkeXEnjoy!Andr√©",1
Good Empire,9mo,2022-06-06,none,16,"Diary of an Equity CrowdfundDay 7 - The Valley of SadnessHi, it‚Äôs Andr√© here, Good Empire founder, with another little update of our Diary of an Equity Crowdfund.It‚Äôs day 7, and in our first week, 335 investors came together, and we reached $300,000 in investments, which is a really solid start.This time on the last crowdfund we did around $200K in the first week and we‚Äôve got a lot more time for this one.A lot of existing shareholders topping up their investments, which is also very encouraging.Our next target is to reach $500,000, which is basically the minimum we need to help us fund this next phase of the business, which is building the full, V1 platform for organisations.¬†We‚Äôre launching the V0 of our app for individuals next Monday the 27th of September, slight delay from the app store, but it‚Äôs now good to go, at least for Android users, with the Apple store still in review.We‚Äôre starting with three simple challenges, based on ocean plastics, reforestation and mental health.And then we‚Äôll be launching some bigger, more involved challenges each week.So back to the crowdfund, we‚Äôre in what is referred to at Birchal as the valley of sadness.After the initial burst of action, off the back of your emails to all your community, investors, customers, friends and family, things settle down.Your ads are all loaded up into facebook‚Äôs ad manager, but they‚Äôre probably still in learning mode, so your cost per conversion is still quite high, while you figure out the right audiences, try out different creative, and you start retargeting the people who come to your Birchal page.We‚Äôve found that it takes people a few days, a few visits, generally, to make an investment, so your costs come down over time naturally. You don‚Äôt see all of your investment conversions right away.So basically, you‚Äôve spent your ad money, but you haven‚Äôt got the attribution yet.So it looks a bit scary, and founders get sad.Maybe nobody loves us after all.This is the time you have to be patient, and have a bit of faith. ¬†We‚Äôre reaching out to investors, asking them to film little spots saying why they‚Äôve invested, for that social proof. We‚Äôll be reaching out via email and SMS to people who expressed their interest, but gently. Still got a couple of weeks.There isn‚Äôt anything really rah rah to shout about, we can talk about things that are actually worth talking about.Like what‚Äôs going on in your real business.Like our app launch. If you‚Äôre interested, feel free to register as a Catalyst on goodempire.org. you can check out those first challenges on the app.I‚Äôll keep you posted on the crowdfund, if you‚Äôd like to invest in this round, if you haven‚Äôt already, go to goodempire.org/invest. Should be a link in this post.Have a good week!",1
Good Empire,9mo,2022-06-06,Day 2: Crowdfund Chronicles with Andre Eikmeier#equitycrowdfunding #investment #startup,7,"The Crowdfund Chronicles - diary of an equity crowdfundDay 2, 11:30am - $220K raised from 242 investorsSo quick update ‚Äì we raised $165K yesterday, day one, from 160 investors, which is a really good start.129 of those people, for around $140K, were what we call EoIs.And that‚Äôs what I wanted to talk about.""EoI"" is just Expression of Interest.Before you launch your crowdfund, you run a phase called EoI. Basically, people just express their interest to invest, they put in their details and select a range that they‚Äôre likely to invest within.An EoI isn‚Äôt binding. It just gives you an idea of how much someone might put in.Then when the crowdfund opens, you can email those people to make their investment.So at the start of the EoI, which we launched two weeks ago ‚Äì normally you‚Äôd go three or four weeks, but we didn‚Äôt want to drag this out. Last time we ran an EoI for 6 weeks, and it was just too long. Too boring.We emailed all our current investors, around 1000, and our community of ‚Äúcatalysts‚Äù, which sits at around 8500 at the moment, but only around 2500 in Australia.Now there are a few countries that allow investment into an Australian equity crowdfund, but you‚Äôre not actually allowed to advertise it outside of Australia.So mostly, you‚Äôre going to get Australian investors. Though we did have about 15 investors from outside Australia last time.We had 650 or so expressions of interest, and Birchal gives you this cool estimate, based on all their past crowdfunds, of how much they think you‚Äôll raise.Ours only came in at $299k - $445K, but last time it was way under what we actually raised too.Still, it‚Äôs a good indicator of how much you‚Äôre likely to have to put into PR and advertising if you want to raise more.Aim is to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù an EoI on an ad for under $20 ($10 is the holy grail). Avg. conversion from EoI to investor is 30%, so you end up with a CPA per new investor of under $60.That‚Äôs the maths, makes it all sound a bit gross, but that‚Äôs performance marketing for you!It actually gets really exciting to track, and it‚Äôs a real honour to have someone invest in your company, from connecting with what you‚Äôre doing on an ad. You really have to get your messaging right.I‚Äôll talk more about that and maybe take you through some of our ads from last time.That‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre now at just over $220K, from 242 investors.Cheers!Andr√©",1
