Add-Life Technologies,2mo,2022-06-06,Glad to see Australian healthcare embracing AI and Telehealth to address stroke diagnosis and recovery. At #addlifetech we are hoping these technologies can help at every stage of the recovery process. #virtualreality #rehabilitation #digitaljourney,1,"In NSW about 18,000 people present with stroke symptoms each year. Typically a CT scan is required.There are 2 types of strokes - those caused by bleeds and those caused by clots.Treatment for clots usually means drugs. Quick administration can save lives/reduce severity of impact.However the challenge is diagnosis. There are only a handful of highly skilled people  - that can read the CT scan and tell the difference between clot/bleed and determine how much of the brain is recoverable.Telestroke enables the emergency physician to obtain urgent 24/7 advice to ascertain the type of stroke and the best treatment.Unsurprisingly - AI is also used to assist the specialists ascertain which parts of the brain are recoverable.🔹 Since it started, 360 - is the number of lives saved/enhanced as a result of Telestroke 🙏Telehealth and virtual healthcare is an area that shows so much promise - to improve quality of life and reduce suffering 🙏#digital #healthcare #digitaljourney",1

Key takeaways:1. At the early stage, ability to execute & quality of team are crucial (e.g. ability to attract the right board, executive team and advisors)2. Other elements that influence valuations include:- industry, market and competition- competitive advantage- early traction (e.g. demonstration of product market fit) - paying customers- profitability- frequency of external capital infusion- brand reputation- business model- team (e.g. quality, background and credentials)3. Pitfalls: - pricing too low (resulting in heavy dilution & potential difficulty raising future rounds)- pricing too high (increased pressure, difficulty attracting quality talent due to value of options decreasing, potentially harder to raise/sell co. in the future)- accuracy of the numbers matters less than sound assumptions behind a model- unreasonable funding timelines and milestones4.

This starts withanalysis using the SASB Standards materiality map, including whether companies and sectors manage material risk, whether and how they report on greenhouse-gas and scope-one, scope-two and scope-three emissions, and how committed the company is to #ESG including board buy-in. The output of this detailed analysis is usually a comprehensive report, Gallagher continued. “For companies that make it through the negative screen, the next step is to carry out fundamental credit analysis including seeking out topical or ESG risks that are not priced in compared with other names within the same sector.” The final stage applies to labelled bonds only. Here, Artesian carries out comprehensive use-of-proceeds (UOP) analysis at security-by-security level.

Most retail businesses have some predictive capability but most investments in the next 5 -10 years are trending towards moving from prescriptive to autonomous stages.Georgie Uppington (Fresh Supply Co.) is witnessing a culture change that is sweeping through #farming and #agriculture sectors. Integrations with ERP decisions are becoming more mainstream and people are now able to integrate more quickly. In the future, this infrastructure push to go digital will become part of compliance.Rushabh Sanghavi (BROSA) is asking himself how to build a truly agile supply chain and would like to see a feedback loop covering a larger no. of stakeholders, even including trends around raw materials.

Besonders spannend finde ich die Modelle des Herstellers Aurrigo mit Sitz in Coventry in der Mitte Englands. Ein Schwerpunkt des Unternehmens liegt auf Transportlösungen für die erste und letzte Meile. Dafür entwickelt die Firma sogenannte Pods, die selbstständig fahren und futuristisch aussehen. Einer davon soll zum Beispiel Fahrgäste an Orten transportieren, wo die Wege von A nach B weit und herkömmliche Verkehrsangebote nicht verfügbar sind. Das gilt etwa für Flughäfen, Universitäten oder Einkaufszentren. Ein weiterer Fokus liegt auf dem Thema Sicherheit. Mit dem Modell Auto-Patrol bietet Aurrigo ein autonomes Fahrzeug, das sich zur Fernüberwachung und Aufklärung einsetzen lässt. Es ist mit Kameras ausgestattet und überträgt die Bilder in Echtzeit an einen Kontrollraum. Zu den Vorteilen gehört etwa, dass das Gefährt rund um die Uhr einsetzbar ist und sich dadurch die Betriebskosten für Sicherheitsvorkehrungen senken lassen.

This is only possible if you put your content as close as possible to the end user. Vodafone has just launched a service with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wavelength to launch the first Multi-access Edge Computing services in the UK. One of the best uses cases of 5G low latency is autonomous vehicles. Today I had the pleasure of interviewing David Keene, the CEO of Aurrigo for a brand new webinar series for Engineers Australia.One of the topics we discussed was how Aurrigo has piloted an autonomous shuttle bus that runs between the park & ride and the campus at Cambridge University, with Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) and 5G capabilities greatly improving safety and performance. This the door for more smart city use cases involving autonomous vehicles, as well as the “mobility as a service” model.This is an excellent example of edge computing in action, and AWS servers will be placed right at the 5G cell-site.The webinar I hosted was part of a new thought leadership series from the UK Chapter of Engineers Australia to showcase innovative companies, products and processes to Australian and UK audiences.On the hour-long webinar, we also discussed• The impact of the recent UK-Australia trade deal on international opportunities• The war for talent• The impact of Covid-19 on Engineers• How Engineers are better able to adapt to challenges such as Covid• The challenges of safety and autonomous vehicles• The importance of critical and holistic thinking• How autonomous vehicles can standardise wear and tear on roads• The cybersecurity threats to vehiclesWatch a replay of the Engineers Australia UK webinar here https://lnkd.in/dHw3BTvRead the Vodafone AWS announcement here https://lnkd.in/denbWic#5G #vodafone #AWS #latency #autonomous #edgecomputing #autonomousvehicles #futurist #actionablefuturist",1

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,none,5,"ASA spends a great deal of time redeploying robots. We’ve seen welding robots from old automotive assembly plants turned into palletising robots for the wine industry. The application scope for a redeployed robot is enormous. The key considerations before you buy are the payload of the robot (the weight it can it hold at the end of the arm), and the working envelope of the robot (how far it can reach). Other considerations are the age of the robot, which can impact the cost of the associated replacement parts, whether you’re trying to integrate the latest technology (such as force sensing) into the robot, and your application (whether you require an IP-67 rated, Foundry, or food grade robot).If you’re thinking about purchasing a second-hand robot, why not contact one of our team to organise a pre-purchase inspection? We can power the robot up, check for wear, and advise you of the configuration (reach/payload). If you’ve got an application in mind, we can probably offer some industry insight on whether it’s the ideal robot for the task.

Code Like a Girl,3mo,2022-06-06,YESSSS 👸  🙌  👏,168,"I taught myself how to code/build/design in Web1.0 by reading source code then testing & learning until it made sense to me at 13. I was making GIFs & animation narratives using online bootlegs of Photoshop to tell stories because flat images didn't say enough. I did this so that I could make fan websites for tv shows & fictional couples I shipped. I was agonising over UX & UI when I coded my own version of social media profiles for my friends on angelfire & geocities long before friendster & bebo took off.I was a MySpace scene girl & optimised my page daily by creative directing colour palettes/images, curating music & copywriting comments/messages/announcements.I’m a Tumblr loyalist, who makes templates & moodboards. Whoever thinks Tumblr is dead isn’t a true community member because it’s still thriving with real fans & freaks like me.I optimise systems for myself across multiple apps/software/platforms. I make notion templates for fun. I can touch type at a shocking speed from years of trolling/flirting in chat rooms. I am an internet expert reduced to burner anon social media accounts because I have to hide my ability as it’s not the “correct way to behave online”. I am a gamer in denial who shops for & designs virtual clothes in secret. I have been essentially living in the metaverse for decades, which is my true reality that I’ve built on the internet.I am a woman in STEM who would never formally be recognised for it because my e-girl knowledge & experience doesn’t follow the textbook process & my style of technical skills but lack of formal qualification would be considered unprofessional. It takes me no time to learn a new platform/app/gameplay/language because I’ve been actively immersed online since my first AOL 30-day free trial disc arrived in the mail as a tween. I love the internet so much that I got a “Mom” heart tattoo in St Marks Place but requested the word “Mom” be changed to “AOL” in commemoration of my e-birth mother.I am a public school princess from a low socio-economic neighbourhood & the first born child of migrant parents. Self-taught hacking was the only viable option. But I didn’t do it for a job or a career. I did it for creative expression. I did it for FREEDOM because I needed to find something online that was better than my reality.The DEI stats across STEM could be easily improved if the definition of inclusion in STEM didn’t rely on a portfolio of commercial or institutionally recognised work. Yet somehow we still ask why there isn’t enough diversity in STEM? Let’s start by asking the right questions & changing our recruitment tactics. Let’s try looking harder at the problem which is BIAS.It’s time to stop gatekeeping access in these professional spaces because the best talent you will ever find is probably making a fansite rn 🧠💻🏴‍☠️ TY to Elizabeth de Luna for igniting this spark.#stem #womeninstem #womenintech #dei #equality #inclusion #futureofwork #futureofeducation #hr #bias",1

It just works better. Coming to us through CLG, Katherine Dixey (our new engineer), Eleanore Kecskes-Judd and Wei Wang offer perspectives and skills from different backgrounds that will bring new eyes to the big problems we’re trying to solve.Here’s an insight into our two interns:Currently studying a Bachelor of Design at Deakin University, Eleanore is one of our UI/UX designers helping to refine solutions for clients so they can gain a better outcome for their problems. Code Like a Girl has helped her get her foot in the door (specifically ours!) in the industry that she wanted to work in. So far @Eleanore has quickly learnt that being a UX/UI engineer is not all about the wireframes and designs. There is so much more that goes into a client project, which will keep her in good stead for her future career aspirations to build innovative tech and mobile solutions for her own clients. In a unique skill set for a future designer, Eleanore is also a talented dancer, and will certainly keep our team light on their feet.Having written her own algorithm on Natural Language Processing for word search, Wei Wang is a perfect fit for our Red Marble tech team. With limited entry level options in her preferred field of data science and machine learning obtained at University of Melbourne, Code Like a Girl provided Wei a golden opportunity to connect with potential jobs. With a goal of becoming a future tech lead, Wei’s focused on becoming as technical as possible, and has already begun learning more on industrial coding style and the way to improve her code quality from our tech lead Andrew Ong.What we didn’t realise when we hired Wei was that we’d also be getting a package deal with her adorable chinchilla cat Kuku who likes to sit in on every meeting.Welcome aboard#aijourney2021 #codelikeagirl #machinelearning #aiatwork #deakinuniversity #universityofmelbourne",1

Diversification"" The three D's quoted by Robert Daw, Chief Innovation Officer at Hexagon Mining to highlight the three major challenges facing the mining industry at the moment. We were fortunate to have Rob join us as our guest speaker at the launch of CORE Connect last night - a monthly conversation series aimed at exploring some of the big questions facing the mining, energy & resources sectors, and to hear from industry-leading players on solutions and pathways to create a greater and more sustainable future for the resources industry.We kicked off the event with some informal networking followed by a CORE Innovation Hub style speed networking session. I'm keen to know for those who attended - did you get to 'three'?Following this, we heard the case study presentation on Hexagon's partnership with Mineral Resources Limited and the successful implementation of the autonomous road train solution. One of the key learnings include the immense opportunities that could be realised for the sector through developing good partnerships - leveraging greater value, efficiencies and sustainable operations. Rob also touched on the importance of looking beyond today and not just to autonomous, but more importantly autonomy. There was a fantastic vibe to our launch event, and each individual brought a great amount of energy for the whole evening. I would have loved for more women in the resources sector to have been a part of this experience though - to have also contributed to the discussion and walked away with great insights and new contacts. I'm aware this is a recurring challenge, but I am interested to know your thoughts on why this might be the case? How can we as a collective do better? Feel free to DM me, as I do feel we all have a role to play when it comes to #diversity, and taking small steps is better than none at all. Thanks Kylah for the reminder.PS.

As the visionary founding editor of Cleo, and later, The Australian Women’s Weekly, Ita had her finger on the pulse of her audience’s changing needs and aspirations. During a recent conversation with our CEO, Julianne Parkinson, Ita shared this valuable perspective on the pervasive trend of age-based discrimination. “Older people know what it's like to be young, but younger people have no idea what it's like to be old. Do not try to walk in our shoes until you have earned the right to do so. Only age affords you that benefit.“There's a lot of active, older people in Australia who would love to be working, but they're discriminated against merely because they're old.“We can change these attitudes by leading by example. The more of us who remain in the workforce as we get older can show, by example, that our work ethic is still strong. Our brains are still working quite efficiently! But you do have to lead by example.”We applaud Ita’s viewpoint and example, and thank Managing Director of Robert Walters NSW, Andrew Hanson and Managing Director of behind closed doors - leading businesswomen Donny Walford FAICD She/Her for co-hosting this vital conversation. #positiveageing",3,"Robert Walters Sydney recently partnered with behind closed doors - leading businesswomen  to host an exclusive cocktail event which featured a conversation between Ita Buttrose AC OBE, Chair of the ABC, and Julianne Parkinson, founding CEO, the Global Centre for Modern Ageing.

GLOBAL CENTRE FOR MODERN AGEING LTD,3w,2022-06-06,"A trailblazing tastemaker and giant of Australian publishing, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Chair Ita Buttrose AC OBE  has always known her customers, appreciating and catering to their individualism. As the visionary founding editor of Cleo, and later, The Australian Women’s Weekly, Ita had her finger on the pulse of her audience’s changing needs and aspirations. During a recent conversation with our CEO, Julianne Parkinson, Ita shared this valuable perspective on the pervasive trend of age-based discrimination. “Older people know what it's like to be young, but younger people have no idea what it's like to be old. Do not try to walk in our shoes until you have earned the right to do so. Only age affords you that benefit.“There's a lot of active, older people in Australia who would love to be working, but they're discriminated against merely because they're old.“We can change these attitudes by leading by example. The more of us who remain in the workforce as we get older can show, by example, that our work ethic is still strong. Our brains are still working quite efficiently! But you do have to lead by example.”We applaud Ita’s viewpoint and example, and thank Managing Director of Robert Walters NSW, Andrew Hanson and Managing Director of behind closed doors - leading businesswomen Donny Walford FAICD She/Her for co-hosting this vital conversation. #positiveageing",3,"Robert Walters Sydney recently partnered with behind closed doors - leading businesswomen  to host an exclusive cocktail event which featured a conversation between Ita Buttrose AC OBE, Chair of the ABC, and Julianne Parkinson, founding CEO, the Global Centre for Modern Ageing.

Which is good.But it's been a looooooong valley of sadness!I won't transcribe this one, so feel free to watch the video for some insights - quite marketing-focused this time, with some metrics.If you'd like to invest, or know someone who might, here's a link: https://lnkd.in/g-DVkeXEnjoy!André",1
Good Empire,9mo,2022-06-06,none,16,"Diary of an Equity CrowdfundDay 7 - The Valley of SadnessHi, it’s André here, Good Empire founder, with another little update of our Diary of an Equity Crowdfund.It’s day 7, and in our first week, 335 investors came together, and we reached $300,000 in investments, which is a really solid start.This time on the last crowdfund we did around $200K in the first week and we’ve got a lot more time for this one.A lot of existing shareholders topping up their investments, which is also very encouraging.Our next target is to reach $500,000, which is basically the minimum we need to help us fund this next phase of the business, which is building the full, V1 platform for organisations. We’re launching the V0 of our app for individuals next Monday the 27th of September, slight delay from the app store, but it’s now good to go, at least for Android users, with the Apple store still in review.We’re starting with three simple challenges, based on ocean plastics, reforestation and mental health.And then we’ll be launching some bigger, more involved challenges each week.So back to the crowdfund, we’re in what is referred to at Birchal as the valley of sadness.After the initial burst of action, off the back of your emails to all your community, investors, customers, friends and family, things settle down.Your ads are all loaded up into facebook’s ad manager, but they’re probably still in learning mode, so your cost per conversion is still quite high, while you figure out the right audiences, try out different creative, and you start retargeting the people who come to your Birchal page.We’ve found that it takes people a few days, a few visits, generally, to make an investment, so your costs come down over time naturally. You don’t see all of your investment conversions right away.So basically, you’ve spent your ad money, but you haven’t got the attribution yet.So it looks a bit scary, and founders get sad.Maybe nobody loves us after all.This is the time you have to be patient, and have a bit of faith.  We’re reaching out to investors, asking them to film little spots saying why they’ve invested, for that social proof. We’ll be reaching out via email and SMS to people who expressed their interest, but gently. Still got a couple of weeks.There isn’t anything really rah rah to shout about, we can talk about things that are actually worth talking about.Like what’s going on in your real business.Like our app launch. If you’re interested, feel free to register as a Catalyst on goodempire.org. you can check out those first challenges on the app.I’ll keep you posted on the crowdfund, if you’d like to invest in this round, if you haven’t already, go to goodempire.org/invest. Should be a link in this post.Have a good week!",1
Good Empire,9mo,2022-06-06,Day 2: Crowdfund Chronicles with Andre Eikmeier#equitycrowdfunding #investment #startup,7,"The Crowdfund Chronicles - diary of an equity crowdfundDay 2, 11:30am - $220K raised from 242 investorsSo quick update – we raised $165K yesterday, day one, from 160 investors, which is a really good start.129 of those people, for around $140K, were what we call EoIs.And that’s what I wanted to talk about.""EoI"" is just Expression of Interest.Before you launch your crowdfund, you run a phase called EoI. Basically, people just express their interest to invest, they put in their details and select a range that they’re likely to invest within.An EoI isn’t binding. It just gives you an idea of how much someone might put in.Then when the crowdfund opens, you can email those people to make their investment.So at the start of the EoI, which we launched two weeks ago – normally you’d go three or four weeks, but we didn’t want to drag this out. Last time we ran an EoI for 6 weeks, and it was just too long. Too boring.We emailed all our current investors, around 1000, and our community of “catalysts”, which sits at around 8500 at the moment, but only around 2500 in Australia.Now there are a few countries that allow investment into an Australian equity crowdfund, but you’re not actually allowed to advertise it outside of Australia.So mostly, you’re going to get Australian investors. Though we did have about 15 investors from outside Australia last time.We had 650 or so expressions of interest, and Birchal gives you this cool estimate, based on all their past crowdfunds, of how much they think you’ll raise.Ours only came in at $299k - $445K, but last time it was way under what we actually raised too.Still, it’s a good indicator of how much you’re likely to have to put into PR and advertising if you want to raise more.Aim is to “convert” an EoI on an ad for under $20 ($10 is the holy grail). Avg. conversion from EoI to investor is 30%, so you end up with a CPA per new investor of under $60.That’s the maths, makes it all sound a bit gross, but that’s performance marketing for you!It actually gets really exciting to track, and it’s a real honour to have someone invest in your company, from connecting with what you’re doing on an ad. You really have to get your messaging right.I’ll talk more about that and maybe take you through some of our ads from last time.That’s it. We’re now at just over $220K, from 242 investors.Cheers!André",1

The entire poem from Margaret Wheatley’s book Turning to One Another is a guide to trusting in the power of your care and finding others who care too, dreaming a new future and having conversations to imagine a new way forward.In episode 50 of The Feminine Edge podcast, I had the privilege of talking with Vicki Saunders (She/Her) Saunders, the founder of the #radical generosity and SheEO™ , a radically generous community supporting women + non-binary people working on the World’s To-Do List. Vicki and SheEO are a living example of how reimagining a world that works for everyone and finding others to share this care can create new models for business grounded in care, relationships and community. They've created an ecosystem rooted in radical generosity, partnership, collaboration and the core belief there is enough for everyone. SheEO invites you to suspend disbelief and engage in a community where everything you need is one ask, one give away. As an activator for the past several years, I can affirm it's a community like no other.The SheEO ecosystem challenges you to put aside your experience with outdated and broken systems and invites you to celebrate and recognize the greatness of the things we are doing as entrepreneurs. Learn More about SheEO: https://sheeo.world/Listen in and nurture your muscle for dreaming about what’s possible!https://lnkd.in/gcRfupW5https://lnkd.in/eRma42yJ",1

Hen House Coop Ltd,7mo,2022-06-06,Thanks Allys Todd for this share #powerofpurchase,3,"Women in Tech- How can we close the Funding Gap?Female entrepreneurs, globally, receive less funding than their male counterparts. This reality is even more pronounced for women of color and those in developing countries, and comes at a great cost to gender parity efforts. As a result of this funding discrepancy, female entrepreneurs lack equal opportunities to innovate and build successful companies that can contribute to the global economy. Furthermore, there is an abundance of evidence to suggest that women entrepreneurs, who receive funding, develop businesses that perform as well, or even better, than their male counterparts, which suggests investors are missing out on attractive investment opportunities. USD 2.5-5 trillionIf women and men were to participate equally as entrepreneurs, global GDP could rise by 3-6%, boosting the world economy by USD 2.5-5 trillion. USD 50 millionTop female founders raise substantially less money than their male counterparts USD 50 million versus USD 226 million and achieve lower valuations for their companies USD 65.5 million versus USD 400.4 million. Moreover, 87% of top founders are on all male founding teams. Meet the extraordinary female founders and entrepreneurs that were shortlisted for the Female Founder Award of the UBS Future of Finance Challenge 2021. With the award UBS, Fortuna Funding LLC and SheEO™  supporting  #femalefounders  in their journey to be successful and help society to close the funding gap.  Auquan:  Chandini Jain Duality Group: Rina Shainski Prof. Shafi Goldwasser  ElasBank: DRA VANISE ZIMMER Entelligent: Pooja Khosla Fairly AI: Fion Lee-Madan (she/her) Fundnel Limited: Khai Lin Sng @The S Factor: Bonnie Lyn de Bartok ValAi : Allys Todd Worldfavor : Frida Emilsson    The first price goes to Kimberley Abbott, CEO and founder of Vested Impact, a company with a mission to 'redefine millionaire to be a person who impact millions of lives' through leveraging data-driven impact assessment to help people invest their money where it makes the best impact on society. She is an Expert Tech Consultant for United Nations -Finalist in 2019, Secretary General’s Award for Innovation, named in 30 Most Innovative Engeners (Australia), UK’s 2017 Top 50 Women of Influence, formally Engeenering Innovation Lead for Thales UK.
