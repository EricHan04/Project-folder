AICraft,2mo,2022-06-06,"AICRAFT’s intern Jamie Keegan-Treloar, the SA Premier’s Defence Industry Scholarship recipient (facilitated by the Australian Industry Group (Ai Group)), is enrolled in Honour degree in Mathematical Sciences at Flinders University. His #internship project is entitled ‘Policy-driven network routing optimisation for a nanosatellite constellation’.Going to #space or sending #satellites on #orbit involves a lot of maths. So, for Jamie it’s been a new experience to apply his knowledge and skills in the enthralling space industry. This is how Jamie describes his most recent simulation:“Satellite networks have a constantly changing topology with nodes coming into connection range only for a short period of time. This #simulation, while only in the early stages, can model a satellites orbit in planes (LEO, MEO and GEO or anywhere in between). Exact orbits can be simulated by providing an initial position and velocity. Each satellite node has a function to ping its neighbours, and over the course of its orbit it builds a map of when and where it is connected to another node”.The placement at AICRAFT gives him an opportunity to model #realistic data and systems, from various antenna types, receiver characteristics, inter-satellite communication, satellite to ground scenarios and vice versa, to variable bandwidths, onboard resources and atmospheric conditions. No aspect is left uncovered.At this stage, several concepts of operations have been put forward and Jamie’s current work is to produce the required data sets. Ultimately, Jamie’s project aims to develop #novel cost functions underlying deep reinforcement learning models and their associated performance metrics that #optimise network routing protocols. These cost functions will implement automatically the policies that will carry out the operator’s objectives most effectively. #internship #spaceindustry #satellite",16,0

Automated,2w,2022-06-06,"Problem: Our client, a bronze and brass foundry producing specialist machined components, purchased a DMG Mori NTX3000, which required a time-consuming process of having a person tend to individual parts in line with production schedules.Our Solution: We automated this process using FANUC R2000iC/270F floor mounted robots. There were three cells in total which have a unique operation, unloading up-to 9x parts from a single raw billet. These parts are either stacked back on the in-feed table, or placed into individual parts on each trolley once the operation is completed. Each robot consists of a set of grippers that it used to load and unload parts from the machine, performing gripper changes between the load (and unload if required). Two of the robots tend a DMG Mori NTX3000 twin spindle multi tasking turn and mill machine while the third tends a DMG Mori NTX2500, twin spindle multi tasking machine.The robots pick the raw bronze billets up from an in-feed table and load them into either the main spindle, or the sub spindle of the machine, depending on the loading operation that has been setup for the part. When the machining cycle has finished, the robot unloads the machined part from either the main spindle or the sub spindle and places this finished part back onto the in-feed trolley. The robot also unloads a remnant piece left over from the machining process, if required. With the robot always ready to pounce, the time between the machine finishing the part, the robot taking it out and loading in a raw billet, and the machine starting the machining process again, is dramatically less than the manual operation.

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,"Problem:  A supplier to the automotive, clean energy, electrical and consumer goods packaging sectors needed a highly creative solution for a limited and confined footprint in their factory.Our Solution: Minimising footprint without compromising work envelope was key. The layout of a 7th axis floor mounted rail system meant four-(4) robots could service a total of nine-(9) machine tools. The addition of the seventh axis provided a solution that didn’t compromise capacity in any way, while minimising footprint.To ensure the optimal solution, ASA was an integrated part of determining the machine tool layout. The system was configured using a mixture of a Fanuc M710iC/20L rail robot, and a stationary Fanuc M20iA robot to tend the machines, and two-(2) FANUC LR Mate 200iD robots for supplementary process work.

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,"The Problem:  Our client, a precision engineering and machining company needed their existing Okuma LB4000 lathe to run unattended for long production runs. Our Solution: The solution had to be a cell with a real focus on autonomy. A Fanuc R2000iC/125L robot was deployed for the task, outfitted with an ATI gripper changeover device that allowed the robot to change grippers automatically based on the part configuration without manual intervention. The robot moved to the three jaw gripper when handling billet parts, and seamlessly back to the two jaw gripper for handling bar stock. The system is designed to use pallets with changeable profiles for easy arrangement and location of blank parts. Machined parts are returned to the pallets and can be replenished during production. Bar stock enters the cell through a bar feeder but an inclined feeder and decline exit chute remains an option that may be utilised in the future. The cell controller incorporates ASA’s easy-to-use robotic machine tending interface, which allows the operator to simply program new products by entering some basic setup dimensions, which the robot can then interpret into a functional program.

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,"Problem:  A global supplier of carbon fibre wheels needed to automate a previously manual deflash process by removing excess resin and fibre using files and sandpaper. Manual removal is very labour intensive and poses the potential for injury as the resin in certain parts of the wheel has the propensity to be thick and sharp. The process was also susceptible to operator variability in the outcome.Our Solution: ASA deployed cutting-edge 6-axis force sensing and profiling technology from FANUC for part for path generation. The M710iC/50 robot was chosen for the task, complete with Fanuc Foundry option for Severe Liquid and Dust Protection, providing an IP56 protection on the main body of the robot, and IP67 on the outer arm and wrist. A single axis positioner table was installed and controlled as an integrated axis of the robot for improved accuracy and control. A sub floor dust collection extraction system was integrated into the solution. The robot was outfitted with Fanuc’s integrated Force Sensor, coupled to a Pushcorp Spindle tool featuring an Automatic Tool Changer (ATC). The cell featured a seven-position tool rack, allowing tools to be automatically changed mid-process for maximum flexibility, whilst also automatically re-calibrating tools. For new path programming, the robot is directed to a spoke “window” and then set to create it’s own path by moving to an adjacent edge, and then profile tracing the window. This method is used to create the nominal path, which is traced in production with the actual cutting tool applying force feedback, provided by the integrated force sensor. Before machining, the force sensor allows the robot to accurately probe the wheel by touching several predefined locations to judge if the wheel loaded corresponds to the program it is about to perform, accurately measuring the orientation of the wheel, and then adapting the process to the actual orientation.

Cellr,5mo,2022-06-06,"To kick off the silly season we asked our staff and friends to tell us the wines they will have on their table for Christmas lunch, and share their fondest memories from 2021.Today we are catching up with Amanda Longworth, an absolute master of branding and strategy when it comes to the wine industry. 🎄 What are 3 wines that will be on your table for Christmas lunch?1. Flaxman Wines Eden Valley Sparkling Shiraz. This will be served at breakfast – with some eggs, bacon and toast.  My first time spending actual Christmas day in Barossa, and as I understand it this is a tradition, to drink sparkling shiraz with breakfast.  No doubt it will get rid of any Christmas eve cobwebs, and set the day off to a good start.  Thankfully it’s just my daughter and husband on Christmas Day, so we can be pretty relaxed, and so I won’t have to stress about cooking for hundreds!2. CHAMPAGNE PIERRE PETERS. Champagne is one of my favourite wines.  It has traded on the notion of celebration for such a long time, so I think when you hear the pop of the cork, that intrinsic association comes to the fore, and you immediately feel happy, and look forward to the first sip. 3. Bethany Wines First Village Rose. After lunch, Christmas day will be spent by the pool, with a great playlist going and just enjoying the day, And a great dry rose is the perfect beverage to while away the afternoon submerged in the cool water, or floating around on the lilo. When we renovated our house we created a little oasis in the backyard, and it’s our favourite place to be in summer.  Typically Christmas is a fabulous, but a more hectic day with lots more family, so I am looking forward to it just being the three of us for a change. 🎄 What you are most looking forward to for Christmas?Opening our presents!  We typically are always away on Christmas day, so taking a lot of presents away is always a bit problematic.  So it will be nice to be opening what I plan to be an abundance of gifts (even if some are just tokens)!🎄 What is your favorite photo taken from this year?This is one of my favourite photos taken with my daughter Aria.  I was grateful that during such uncertain times, I was able to get to Queensland and attend her end of year 12 celebrations.  Of course, Champagne as always at the ready.#christmasiscoming #winelist #Cellr",40,0

Chaffey Bros. Wine Co. FUNKELPUNKT Sparkling. There’s a few vegans around our xmas table so I need to make sure that at least the sparkling fits the bill. Chaffey Bros is a great label, part of the Artisan of Barossa group and it’s fast become our go to Xmas sparkling. It is definitely batting above its price point.2. The Islander Estate Vineyards 2005 – The Investigator Cabernet Franc. I really love what Jacques Lurton is doing down on Kangaroo Island. The winery is well worth a visit if you’re down there any time. I am a huge Cabernet Franc fan and it is just such a great lunch time wine that goes with most foods or can hold itself up on its own.3. Langmeil Winery 2004 – Vintage Port. You can’t have pudding without a good port and I’ve got a few of these beauties in the cellar that I’ve been working through over the past few years. For me, it’s not really Christmas without at least one bottle of Langmeil on the table. They were the first wine brand that really made me feel part of the family. So I like to share their wines with my family.🎄 What you are most looking forward to for Christmas?I am most looking forward to the break and just winding down, I haven’t taken really any leave this year with so many key client projects on. Besides a working holiday in Pt Neill in August this year with a bit of fishing, it’s been go…go…go… all year. This is a chance to sit back, reflect and celebrate all of the success and set myself up for another cracking 2022.🎄 What is your favorite photo taken from this year?At the start of the year I decided I needed to start better looking after myself. I jumped back into a sport I hadn’t studied since my early teens; Taekwondo. My daughter Matilda, then showed interest as did my partner Katharine. So, for the most part of the year, we’ve been a Taekwondo family and have been pushing ourselves. This photo is from our second grading of the year. What’s most important for me this year is the supporting nature of the Ilyo Taekwondo Barossa club. We’ve all created some great friendships this year through the club and we love achieving together as a family.#christmasiscoming #winelist #Cellr",23,0

It’s a day of recognition, reflection and inquiry.  A day to look at how far we haven’t come and to set courageous goals for the future - the near future to be specific.In my work for Code Like a Girl, I seek to encourage businesses to open their minds and strategies to the possibilities created when they provide a supportive, safe and inclusive environment. The future WILL be flexible workplaces and jobs, parental leave for all, skills and experience being more valued than time in a chair, leaders celebrated for their empathy more than their power or bravado. But that future is coming too slow. The next generation of women will inherit the problems we face if swift action isn’t taken.I don’t want my daughter to feel any industry, job or achievement is out of reach simply for being born female. And I want my son to embrace inclusivity by sharing the benefits given to him simply for the gender, and skin colour, he was born with. Skills and passion aren’t handed out based on gender, but opportunity is. It’s time to realise what has been won’t always be. The time to #BreaktheBias is now.”",104,0

If like us, you've been seeking out ways to respond, please consider donating to any of the following organisations: - Women for Afghan Women: womenforafghanwomen.org/- International Rescue Committee: www.rescue.org/- Women for Women International: support.womenforwomen.org/Or if you're unable to donate, write to your MP or seek out the many open letters to our government and demand expedited resettlement or #amnesty of Afghan #refugees.#HelpAfghanistan #WomensRights #WomenSupportingWomen",59,0

Space Waste is a growing problem with more than 34,000 objects, greater than 10 centimetres in size currently orbiting the planet!!Our next #Hot30 Winner Exodus Space Systems is developing a solution to the space debris problem, approaching the solution in a fundamentally new way. Rather than using the more common Active Debris Removal methods, Exodus Space System has developed its Kinetic Solution for Space Debris (KiSSD).The KiSSD solution performs flyby maneuvers that deploy a multitude of low-density particles into the path of the debris. These low-density particles slow down the debris allowing it to fall back into the atmosphere where it will then burn up harmlessly like a meteor. Pretty cool!

When shined onto a material, these laser bursts create extremely high temperatures and pressures that turn the material into plasma, the fourth state of matter.These lasers (known as ultrashort and short pulsed lasers (USPL)) are orders of magnitude more powerful than standard lasers and capable of vaporising or liquidising objects.""The scope of USPL applications is expanding rapidly and requires new laser sources technology to enable them,"" says Dr Ganija. ""The range of applications is very broad, encompassing industrial, scientific, medical, environmental, and sensing and defence. Some commentators predict that the 21st century will be the 'USPL century', mirroring the rapid growth in technology in the 20th century with the development of solid-state electronics.""https://lnkd.in/g6sSgVRt#DefenceScience #research #laser #technology University of Adelaide Australian Department of Defence",83,0

Nosso foco nesse post, é o D de digitalização.​O aumento da demanda de energia por pessoas e empresas traz grandes desafios para o setor elétrico brasileiro. Afinal, como fazer para suportar o crescente consumo, evitar problemas de fornecimento e reduzir custos operacionais? Uma das respostas está na digitalização da rede elétrica, porque traz inteligência ao sistema, permitindo uma atuação mais preventiva do que reativa, o que beneficia concessionárias, empresas, pessoas e o poder público.​​A digitalização da rede elétrica consiste em um conjunto de tecnologias e sistemas, que têm como objetivo facilitar a gestão e simplificar nossa relação com a energia. Medidas como enterramento da rede, captação de imagens termográficas e em alta resolução, instalação de sensores, compartilhamento e monitoramento de dados em tempo real entre os diferentes sistemas, são apenas algumas das inovações que se desenham no futuro da distribuição de energia. ​A implantação de redes inteligentes, nas fases de transmissão e distribuição de energia – fases importantes para a digitalização do sistema -, permite monitorar o consumo na rede, aumentando o poder de detecção de eventuais falhas e possibilitando mensurarmos a quantidade de armazenamento de energia existente em horários de pouca demanda. Outra ação proporcionada pelas redes inteligentes é a possibilidade do acionamento de mecanismos específicos para evitar a interrupção do serviço, quando necessário. E tudo isso, absolutamente, em tempo real.​Para que a digitalização ocorra, é necessário o emprego de tecnologias como Inteligência Artificial, Internet das Coisas, Blockchain, entre outras. Uma de nossas expertises é saber aplicar o D de digitalização na hora de modelar negócios para geração e comercialização de energia, desenvolvendo soluções tecnológicas para que eles operem perfeitamente. ​Saiba mais sobre os 3Ds Energia em nossa série, por aqui.

Fohat,7mo,2022-06-06,"A Fohat eTech Global está entre as melhores empresas que disponibilizam soluções de microrrede no mundo, segundo relatório da  Reports Insights Consulting Pvt Ltd, empresa especializada em pesquisa contextual e centrada em dados para empresas do mundo todo.​ ​Microrredes de energia são redes locais de distribuição e consumo de energia elétrica, que podem operar autônoma e isoladamente do sistema de distribuição central de uma região, conseguindo assim manter o fornecimento de energia local quando houver necessidade. Entre suas principais características estão a integração sistematizada de seus componentes e o controle da geração e do armazenamento energético. ​ ​A Fohat eTech Global acredita que as microrredes inteligentes podem impactar positivamente consumidores, concessionárias de energia e até mesmo o sistema elétrico Brasileiro de maneira geral, uma vez que possibilitam a contenção da carga do sistema centralizado. Outro benefício é a geração de soluções relacionadas ao aumento da demanda energética brasileira e aos problemas com a segurança energética.​ ​#energyintelligence #energia #microrrede #microgrid",14,0
Fohat,7mo,2022-06-06,"O Brasil  foi um dos destaques no relatório final da COP 26, no capítulo que trata da diversificação da matriz elétrica dos países signatários da ONU.​​A solução dada pelo governo brasileiro nos anos 2000 foi usada como referência pela conferência da ONU, para que os atuais líderes mundiais usem, atualmente, o que deu certo em um passado recente, uma vez que a geração e o consumo de energia impactam diretamente nas mudanças climáticas.​​Na época citada no relatório, 75% da energia elétrica brasileira era hídrica. As ações tomadas na primeira década de 2000 resultaram no impulsionamento das indústrias solar, eólica e de LED, a partir de 2010.  Hoje, a matriz elétrica depende 63% da energia hídrica, com notável crescimento na participação de outras fontes, em especial das renováveis eólica (9,2%), biomassa (9,0%) e solar (1,3%).​​Se olharmos apenas para o crescimento da geração, a evolução é ainda mais relevante, pois  a energia solar centralizada (gerada por grandes usinas) cresceu  200%, enquanto a solar distribuída (produzida por pequenas centrais de geração) passou de 2.000% de aumento, a partir de 2015.​​A cadeia da eólica também evoluiu muito. Para ela, a estratégia do governo brasileiro foi a nacionalização da indústria de bens e serviços  eólicos, e a fonte eólica foi a que mais cresceu no país em participação nos leilões desde 2009. ​​O relatório da COP 26 concluiu que os governos são essenciais para incentivar a utilização de energia limpa e cumprir as metas do Acordo de Paris. Além disso, as políticas de modelagem de mercado podem desempenhar um papel fundamental para acelerar novas tecnologias de energia limpa, encorajando a colaboração internacional para impulsionar a inovação em rápida escala nesta década.​Nós concordamos com isso!​Se você quer saber mais sobre transição energética, nos acompanhe aqui!​​#EnergyForABetterLife #EnergyIntelligence #energy #innovation#inovação #inteligência #alternativeenergy #COP26 #Juntospelonossoplaneta",19,0

Fohat,6mo,2022-06-06,"Hoje destacaremos o D de #descentralização dos 3Ds Energia, já que falamos antes dos outros dois, de #digitalização e #descarbonização. ​​A descentralização energética significa reduzir a distância entre a geração e o consumo da energia. No Brasil, a geração descentralizada de energia significa produzir energia de fontes renováveis, em locais mais próximos de onde ela será consumida. Isso pode acontecer por meio de painéis solares fotovoltaicos e turbinas eólicas distribuídos em telhados e terras agrícolas, biomassa ou até mesmo por geração hídrica, em pequenas proporções de infraestrutura civil.​Entre as principais vantagens de um modelo descentralizado, podemos citar: a redução de emissões de gás carbônico, a utilização racional de energia, a diversificação de recursos energéticos, uma grande melhoria no fornecimento e confiabilidade e a disponibilidade de energia em lugares de difícil acesso. ​​Mas, para que isso ocorra, é preciso um processo de digitalização dos ativos e de uma comunicação inteligente, que sinalize as melhores oportunidades de produção em termos de tempo e montante. Essa integração se realiza com tecnologia de ponta, aplicada em sistemas e plataformas criadas para solucionar as especificidades de cada mercado.​​Nesse sentido os 3Ds Energia se complementam e atuam coordenadamente para viabilizar a transição energética em cada país. Para o Brasil, nós estamos focados em soluções de negócios e produtos tecnológicos que tangibilizam a Energia na prática.

Fohat,6mo,2022-06-06,"A #descarbonização é o segundo D dos 3Ds Energia que tratamos nessa série, no dia de hoje.  A descarbonização do sistema energético significa usar energia gerada a partir de fontes com baixo carbono. Na prática, é a migração da energia gerada a partir de fontes fósseis para as renováveis, visando eliminar os gases emitidos pelas indústrias e pelos veículos movidos à gasolina ou a diesel.​ ​Sob o âmbito da transição energética, o D de descarbonização é a principal maneira de buscarmos a redução, a médio e longo prazos, da emissão de gás carbônico pelas empresas e pessoas, o que tanto tem prejudicado o planeta em função do impacto no equilíbrio ambiental. É a direção para encontrar formas de produzir bens de consumo com baixo carbono. Para encontrar meios de termos veículos movidos a combustíveis provenientes de fontes renováveis. Também é uma forma de acharmos alternativas para armazenar e distribuir energia de forma a colaborar com um modelo mais descentralizado. ​ Logo, além do impacto positivo no meio ambiente, a adoção de mecanismos que visam a  descarbonização energética também provocará mudanças em vários segmentos de mercado, pois vão surgir novas formas de mobilidade, de consumo e de relacionamento com bens e serviços.​ Nesse sentido, a descarbonização se conecta com a digitalização, que tratamos no post anterior.

GLOBAL CENTRE FOR MODERN AGEING LTD,11mo,2022-06-06,"Ageing should be seen as an opportunity, not a burden. The 2021 Intergenerational Report, released last week, outlines that our population is ageing and this is a growth trajectory not expected to decline. We suggest, as Australians age,  they will seek out products and solutions that meet their needs.  Our CEO, Julianne Parkinson says, “The recently released Intergenerational Report, highlighted that Australia will need to manage a large and ageing population in years to come. The Treasurer indicated the report as an ‘early warning sign’, but we see this report as a sign for Australia to start positively preparing for this future. Ageing doesn’t need to be a burden if as a county we’re thoroughly prepared.”Our Ageing in the Right Place Research Report highlights how innovative businesses have the chance to leverage the opportunities arising from the modern ageing phenomenon and the increased demand for better housing, retirement living and aged care options.

A year for us as organisations, as humans, to come together and say, it’s time. Because if not us, then who? And if not now, then when? A new era calls for a new kind of action. There’s no more time to feel disempowered. There is only time to take action and to take responsibility.  And not just through making donations or signing petitions, but through real action that has genuine impact, at scale, and inspires others to create movements of change. It is time. 2022, it’s the year to reduce carbon emissions and ocean plastics, regenerate forests and restore biodiversity. It’s the year to free communities from hunger and poverty, and open up access to health and education. 2022, the year to empower women and girls and create equality and opportunity for every human. 2022 is our year. It’s time to put our hands up. Your organisation has power. Your people have power. We work everyday but we want our work to be meaningful, to say we did something that helped people and planet. We want to be able to say that we helped to educate 100 girls, we removed 100,000 pieces of plastic from the ocean, we helped to free 1000 people from hunger, we helped house 30 people experiencing homelessness, we helped 50,000 people with their mental wellbeing. We want to look back on our lives and our time working and say, we did that. We, a nation without borders, united around a shared vision for the world and willingness to act. United in our belief that as individuals and organisations with privilege and opportunity, we have a responsibility to take action to help create a more abundant, equitable and sustainable world. We know you care. Your people care. So it’s time for organisations to become part of the solution. It’s time for us to step up. It’s time for us to come together, to work together, to solve together, to act together, to have impact together. So, will you join our calling? Because if not us, then who?

He takes us on his career journey from a real genuine place; no stone goes unturned.""There are enough people that care in the world with enough means to solve most of the problems we've got, including climate change, if we all get on with it."" This is the attitude that Good Empire grounds itself in, and if we're being real, it's the energy we need to level up for people and planet.",19,0
Good Empire,7mo,2022-06-06,"Check out a recent podcast interview with Andre Eikmeier through HubSpot and their Unconventional Business podcast:  https://lnkd.in/g3FMaVAu, also available on all good podcasting apps. “Those of us that have the ability we need to be building stuff in the world that’s good, we need to be taking on the bigger problems, we need to be figuring out solutions.For those of us that care about people and planet, we either spend all our energy arguing with people that don’t care, and that burns a limited amount of energy to put to this, that burns it. I think we realise there’s enough of us to solve everything. We can just let go of the people that don’t want to contribute. So, then, what do we do with that energy? We either petition because we feel disempowered because we don’t feel like anything we can do will make a difference, so we feel like all we can do is to put weight of demand pressure on governments. When governments make legislation change that’s big and forces change like stopping single use plastics or cutting carbon emissions and that’s good, it helps. But, what are we doing sitting on our knees begging someone like f**king Scott Morrison to tell us what our carbon zero targets should be? Why can’t we organise around that and set our own targets, as intelligent, motivated and driven people? That was one of the motivators behind Good Empire.” - André Eikmeier, Founder & CEO Good Empire. #podcast #socialenterprise",11,0

Hen House Coop Ltd,4mo,2022-06-06,"ReNest 002 was stunning, with the thoughtful, generous and informative Alexandra Brown. Alexandra took us through investing with a #genderlens and some of the data was breath-taking and some of the examples full of hope. The #gaps are huge and we know that #gendergaps are at the heart of all #inequities. Alexandra asked us to be on the look out for #pinkwashing. She reminded us that when women fuel #finance finance fuels women. We got some very practical tips on what to ask for in our investing, our spending and supporting companies with policies that support women's circumstances. Alexandra invited us to consider all that we do in finance through a gender lens by being informed and shared some excellent data and research sites we will be able to use in our #advocacy and with our members.Thanks to those who joined us and if you'd like to share your takeaway in the comments below that would be great.

Hen House Coop Ltd,11mo,2022-06-06,"#naidoc2021  theme of Heal Country is an invitation to us all to enter into the spaces and places where we can find healing and hope.  The gender investment gap for women of colour and especially First Nations women is extreme. This doesn't happen by accident. Gaps of these proportions are a direct relationship to our systems being skewed and based on values and principles that exclude and inhibit opportunities for equity and justice. We are pleased to have members of the Hen House who help us learn to voice the issues, tell the truth and work towards more just and equitable outcomes.  Thanks Melissa Clarke, who as a member of the Hen House, has given us advice on how to be more inclusive and also a shout out to Dana Shen who provided early advice in our time of formation. We have a long way to go. As a co-op we express the value of #solidarity and this extends  to all First Nations people seeking to close the very many gaps, including investment. We hope we can make a  contribution to closing these gaps via divesting from patriarchal and colonial systems that keep these injustices in place.Founder & Chief Chook Moira Were AM with the Uluru Statement#healcountry #closethegaps #coops",11,0

IO Energy,10mo,2022-06-06,"CO2 levels are now higher than what they have been at any point over the last 2 million years. 💨We've emitted the same amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere in the last 30 years as we did from the beginning of human history to 1990.With such a stark increase in emissions, our planet will experience longer fire seasons, greater flooding, and yet also harsher droughts. 🔥🌧☀️At IO Energy, we remain committed to reducing the impacts of climate change by ensuring our customers make use of cleaner electricity, through smarter usage.Find out more about what the IPCC has to say below👇#climatechange #globalwarming #climate",11,0
IO Energy,11mo,2022-06-06,"Australian Energy Regulator figures show wind and solar's coupled output has hit record levels at 19 per cent of the mix. This has been followed by the average price of electricity falling to below $70 a megawatt hour, the lowest since 2015. ♻️With an increase of renewables in the grid and the price of electricity falling, our mission remains the same: save consumers money through smarter use of renewable energy.⚡️#renewableenergy #cleanenergy #sustainabilty",15,0

IO Energy,7mo,2022-06-06,"Which direction do you believe is best to install solar panels? 🤔Orienting North allows you to maximise supply as your panels are exposed to the sun more often, generating more electricity over the course of the day. ☀️However, supply is not useful without demand. This is common for many Australians, whose typical load profile follows the example below. During the middle of the day, demand drops significantly.📈For this reason, we suggest orienting your solar panels West as you will be catering to the evening demand. This is when demand is greatest, giving the customer greater returns. 📍#solar #cleanenergy #renewables",7,0

IO Energy,10mo,2022-06-06,"We talk a lot about our customers paying less for cleaner electricity by being smarter energy users but what does that mean? 🤔The graph below shows the average hourly share of renewables in the South Australian electrical grid, over an entire year. As you can see, there is an abundance of renewables in the grid between 10am and 3pm. You can also see a major dip in renewables around 5pm to 9pm. ♻️Why is this important? Well, it means the price of electricity is lower during the day, and greater during the evening peak. Most electricity retailers have flat pricing that offers no reason to use more renewables, but IO Energy rewards better behaviours by passing on savings from affordable renewable energy. 💡Our customers do this by installing smart meters, choosing time-of-use electrical plans, monitoring their consumption data, and shifting as much usage as possible to clean and cheap periods. #renewableenergy #cleanenergy #cleanenergytransition",11,0

IO Energy,11mo,2022-06-06,"Interesting graph created by Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) detailing the current and projected average wholesale electricity price hourly in SA.  As you can see, the average price is and will continue to drop significantly between 10am and 3pm. Conversely, the price does and will continue to steeply increase in peak periods around 6pm to 10pm. We remain committed to offering flexible pricing options for consumers, which reward higher daytime usage when renewables are abundant and prices are significantly lower. #renewableenergy #electricity #cleanenergy",15,0
