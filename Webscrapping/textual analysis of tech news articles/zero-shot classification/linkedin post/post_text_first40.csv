His #internship project is entitled ‚ÄòPolicy-driven network routing optimisation for a nanosatellite constellation‚Äô.Going to #space or sending #satellites on #orbit involves a lot of maths. So, for Jamie it‚Äôs been a new experience to apply his knowledge and skills in the enthralling space industry. This is how Jamie describes his most recent simulation:‚ÄúSatellite networks have a constantly changing topology with nodes coming into connection range only for a short period of time. This #simulation, while only in the early stages, can model a satellites orbit in planes (LEO, MEO and GEO or anywhere in between). Exact orbits can be simulated by providing an initial position and velocity. Each satellite node has a function to ping its neighbours, and over the course of its orbit it builds a map of when and where it is connected to another node‚Äù.The placement at AICRAFT gives him an opportunity to model #realistic data and systems, from various antenna types, receiver characteristics, inter-satellite communication, satellite to ground scenarios and vice versa, to variable bandwidths, onboard resources and atmospheric conditions. No aspect is left uncovered.At this stage, several concepts of operations have been put forward and Jamie‚Äôs current work is to produce the required data sets. Ultimately, Jamie‚Äôs project aims to develop #novel cost functions underlying deep reinforcement learning models and their associated performance metrics that #optimise network routing protocols. These cost functions will implement automatically the policies that will carry out the operator‚Äôs objectives most effectively.¬†#internship #spaceindustry #satellite",16,0

Automated,2w,2022-06-06,"Problem: Our client, a bronze and brass foundry producing specialist machined components, purchased a DMG Mori NTX3000, which required a time-consuming process of having a person tend to individual parts in line with production schedules.Our Solution: We automated this process using FANUC R2000iC/270F floor mounted robots. There were three cells in total which have a unique operation, unloading up-to 9x parts from a single raw billet. These parts are either stacked back on the in-feed table, or placed into individual parts on each trolley once the operation is completed. Each robot consists of a set of grippers that it used to load and unload parts from the machine, performing gripper changes between the load (and unload if required). Two of the robots tend a DMG Mori NTX3000 twin spindle multi tasking turn and mill machine while the third tends a DMG Mori NTX2500, twin spindle multi tasking machine.The robots pick the raw bronze billets up from an in-feed table and load them into either the main spindle, or the sub spindle of the machine, depending on the loading operation that has been setup for the part. When the machining cycle has finished, the robot unloads the machined part from either the main spindle or the sub spindle and places this finished part back onto the in-feed trolley. The robot also unloads a remnant piece left over from the machining process, if required. With the robot always ready to pounce, the time between the machine finishing the part, the robot taking it out and loading in a raw billet, and the machine starting the machining process again, is dramatically less than the manual operation.

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,"The Problem:  Our client, a precision engineering and machining company needed their existing Okuma LB4000 lathe to run unattended for long production runs. Our Solution: The solution had to be a cell with a real focus on autonomy. A Fanuc R2000iC/125L robot was deployed for the task, outfitted with an ATI gripper changeover device that allowed the robot to change grippers automatically based on the part configuration without manual intervention. The robot moved to the three jaw gripper when handling billet parts, and seamlessly back to the two jaw gripper for handling bar stock. The system is designed to use pallets with changeable profiles for easy arrangement and location of blank parts. Machined parts are returned to the pallets and can be replenished during production. Bar stock enters the cell through a bar feeder but an inclined feeder and decline exit chute remains an option that may be utilised in the future.

Automated,1mo,2022-06-06,"Problem:  A global supplier of carbon fibre wheels needed to automate a previously manual deflash process by removing excess resin and fibre using files and sandpaper. Manual removal is very labour intensive and poses the potential for injury as the resin in certain parts of the wheel has the propensity to be thick and sharp. The process was also susceptible to operator variability in the outcome.Our Solution: ASA deployed cutting-edge 6-axis force sensing and profiling technology from FANUC for part for path generation. The M710iC/50 robot was chosen for the task, complete with Fanuc Foundry option for Severe Liquid and Dust Protection, providing an IP56 protection on the main body of the robot, and IP67 on the outer arm and wrist. A single axis positioner table was installed and controlled as an integrated axis of the robot for improved accuracy and control. A sub floor dust collection extraction system was integrated into the solution. The robot was outfitted with Fanuc‚Äôs integrated Force Sensor, coupled to a Pushcorp Spindle tool featuring an Automatic Tool Changer (ATC). The cell featured a seven-position tool rack, allowing tools to be automatically changed mid-process for maximum flexibility, whilst also automatically re-calibrating tools. For new path programming, the robot is directed to a spoke ‚Äúwindow‚Äù and then set to create it‚Äôs own path by moving to an adjacent edge, and then profile tracing the window. This method is used to create the nominal path, which is traced in production with the actual cutting tool applying force feedback, provided by the integrated force sensor. Before machining, the force sensor allows the robot to accurately probe the wheel by touching several predefined locations to judge if the wheel loaded corresponds to the program it is about to perform, accurately measuring the orientation of the wheel, and then adapting the process to the actual orientation.

We were also able to use two Conext‚Ñ¢ MPPT charge controllers for a tailored roof design, and expandability to more solar, batteries or vehicle-to-grid charging.Finally, we are installing Insight Energy Management for monitoring, optimization and control of these energy sources with full support for IEEE 2030.5 allowing VPP (virtual power plant) interoperability integrated with AZZO's EnergyX IoT platform for co-orchestration with utility DERMS products in the future.#renewableenergy #solar #batterystorage #ecoxpert #ecostruxure",57,0
Azzo,10mo,2022-06-06,"A day in the life of a utility scale solar farm project - today, it's the network. Every balance of plant SCADA and Control System is utterly reliant on a secure, properly segregated, high speed comms network - explicitly designed for closed loop control across a large footprint. Even 200ms is a long time when you're controlling hundreds of MW/MVAr on the NEM.As the energy transformation continues and we move to a more distributed grid, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) will need our industry to keep raising the bar on comms so they can do their job of managing our electricity network with reliable forecasting, trusting we will do what we say, with greater certainty.AZZO fully bench tests every project design in a simulated network to be sure of reliable and redundant communications architectures which the O&M team and AEMO can rely on in production.

Flaxman Wines Eden Valley Sparkling Shiraz. This will be served at breakfast ‚Äì with some eggs, bacon and toast.  My first time spending actual Christmas day in Barossa, and as I understand it this is a tradition, to drink sparkling shiraz with breakfast.  No doubt it will get rid of any Christmas eve cobwebs, and set the day off to a good start.  Thankfully it‚Äôs just my daughter and husband on Christmas Day, so we can be pretty relaxed, and so I won‚Äôt have to stress about cooking for hundreds!2. CHAMPAGNE PIERRE PETERS. Champagne is one of my favourite wines.  It has traded on the notion of celebration for such a long time, so I think when you hear the pop of the cork, that intrinsic association comes to the fore, and you immediately feel happy, and look forward to the first sip. 3. Bethany Wines First Village Rose. After lunch, Christmas day will be spent by the pool, with a great playlist going and just enjoying the day, And a great dry rose is the perfect beverage to while away the afternoon submerged in the cool water, or floating around on the lilo. When we renovated our house we created a little oasis in the backyard, and it‚Äôs our favourite place to be in summer.  Typically Christmas is a fabulous, but a more hectic day with lots more family, so I am looking forward to it just being the three of us for a change. üéÑ What you are most looking forward to for Christmas?Opening our presents!

Space Waste is a growing problem with more than 34,000 objects, greater than 10 centimetres in size currently orbiting the planet!!Our next #Hot30 Winner Exodus Space Systems is developing a solution to the space debris problem, approaching the solution in a fundamentally new way. Rather than using the more common Active Debris Removal methods, Exodus Space System has developed its Kinetic Solution for Space Debris (KiSSD).The KiSSD solution performs flyby maneuvers that deploy a multitude of low-density particles into the path of the debris. These low-density particles slow down the debris allowing it to fall back into the atmosphere where it will then burn up harmlessly like a meteor. Pretty cool!

Nosso foco nesse post, √© o D de digitaliza√ß√£o.‚ÄãO aumento da demanda de energia por pessoas e empresas traz grandes desafios para o setor el√©trico brasileiro. Afinal, como fazer para suportar o crescente consumo, evitar problemas de fornecimento e reduzir custos operacionais? Uma das respostas est√° na digitaliza√ß√£o da rede el√©trica, porque traz intelig√™ncia ao sistema, permitindo uma atua√ß√£o mais preventiva do que reativa, o que beneficia concession√°rias, empresas, pessoas e o poder p√∫blico.‚Äã‚ÄãA digitaliza√ß√£o da rede el√©trica consiste em um conjunto de tecnologias e sistemas, que t√™m como objetivo facilitar a gest√£o e simplificar nossa rela√ß√£o com a energia. Medidas como enterramento da rede, capta√ß√£o de imagens termogr√°ficas e em alta resolu√ß√£o, instala√ß√£o de sensores, compartilhamento e monitoramento de dados em tempo real entre os diferentes sistemas, s√£o apenas algumas das inova√ß√µes que se desenham no futuro da distribui√ß√£o de energia. ‚ÄãA implanta√ß√£o de redes inteligentes, nas fases de transmiss√£o e distribui√ß√£o de energia ‚Äì fases importantes para a digitaliza√ß√£o do sistema -, permite monitorar o consumo na rede, aumentando o poder de detec√ß√£o de eventuais falhas e possibilitando mensurarmos a quantidade de¬†armazenamento de energia existente em hor√°rios de pouca demanda. Outra a√ß√£o proporcionada pelas redes inteligentes √© a possibilidade do acionamento de mecanismos espec√≠ficos para evitar a interrup√ß√£o do servi√ßo, quando necess√°rio. E tudo isso, absolutamente, em tempo real.‚ÄãPara que a digitaliza√ß√£o ocorra, √© necess√°rio o emprego de tecnologias como Intelig√™ncia Artificial, Internet das Coisas, Blockchain, entre outras.

Fohat,7mo,2022-06-06,"O Brasil¬† foi um dos destaques no relat√≥rio final da COP 26, no cap√≠tulo que trata da diversifica√ß√£o da matriz el√©trica dos pa√≠ses signat√°rios da ONU.‚Äã‚ÄãA solu√ß√£o dada pelo governo brasileiro nos anos 2000 foi usada como refer√™ncia pela confer√™ncia da ONU, para que os atuais l√≠deres mundiais usem, atualmente, o que deu certo em um passado recente, uma vez que a gera√ß√£o e o consumo de energia impactam diretamente nas mudan√ßas clim√°ticas.‚Äã‚ÄãNa √©poca citada no relat√≥rio, 75% da energia el√©trica brasileira era h√≠drica. As a√ß√µes tomadas na primeira d√©cada de 2000 resultaram no impulsionamento das ind√∫strias solar, e√≥lica e de LED, a partir de 2010.¬† Hoje, a matriz el√©trica depende 63% da energia h√≠drica, com not√°vel crescimento na participa√ß√£o de outras fontes, em especial das renov√°veis e√≥lica (9,2%), biomassa (9,0%) e solar (1,3%).‚Äã‚ÄãSe olharmos apenas para o crescimento da gera√ß√£o, a evolu√ß√£o √© ainda mais relevante, pois¬† a energia solar centralizada (gerada por grandes usinas) cresceu¬† 200%, enquanto a solar distribu√≠da (produzida por pequenas centrais de gera√ß√£o) passou de 2.000% de aumento, a partir de 2015.‚Äã‚ÄãA cadeia da e√≥lica tamb√©m evoluiu muito. Para ela, a estrat√©gia do governo brasileiro foi a nacionaliza√ß√£o da ind√∫stria de bens e servi√ßos  e√≥licos, e a fonte e√≥lica foi a que mais cresceu no pa√≠s em participa√ß√£o nos leil√µes desde 2009. ‚Äã‚ÄãO relat√≥rio da COP 26 concluiu que os governos s√£o essenciais para incentivar a utiliza√ß√£o de energia limpa e cumprir as metas do Acordo de Paris.

No Brasil, a gera√ß√£o descentralizada de energia significa produzir energia de fontes renov√°veis, em locais mais pr√≥ximos de onde ela ser√° consumida. Isso pode acontecer por meio de pain√©is solares fotovoltaicos e turbinas e√≥licas distribu√≠dos em telhados e terras agr√≠colas, biomassa ou at√© mesmo por gera√ß√£o h√≠drica, em pequenas propor√ß√µes de infraestrutura civil.‚ÄãEntre as principais vantagens de um modelo descentralizado, podemos citar: a redu√ß√£o de emiss√µes de g√°s carb√¥nico, a utiliza√ß√£o racional de energia, a diversifica√ß√£o de recursos energ√©ticos, uma grande melhoria no fornecimento e confiabilidade e a disponibilidade de energia em lugares de dif√≠cil acesso. ‚Äã‚ÄãMas, para que isso ocorra, √© preciso um processo de digitaliza√ß√£o dos ativos e de uma comunica√ß√£o inteligente, que sinalize as melhores oportunidades de produ√ß√£o em termos de tempo e montante.

We got some very practical tips on what to ask for in our investing, our spending and supporting companies with policies that support women's circumstances.

We have a long way to go. As a co-op we express the value of #solidarity and this extends  to all First Nations people seeking to close the very many gaps, including investment.
