"Typically, a wind turbine blade will be inspected manually or via drone but in some cases this could leave a site unexamined for up to a year. While OEMS or operators may identify catastrophic damage, for example from a lightning strike, due to the visual impact, minor damage will be hard to track. Like with car or house repairs, the longer we leave it the worse it gets.

"We’re thrilled to today announce a project we’ve been working on behind the scenes for a while – our new Ice Detection System. Ice on turbine blades is a significant issue in some colder climates, causing damage and potentially becoming a safety hazard. This can lead to turbines being shut down for long periods and subject to dangerous ice load resulting in revenue and energy shortages. We’ve developed a software upgrade to our system specifically to ensure we can identify ice damage via continuous acoustic monitoring. Wind energy is a rapidly expanding sector, and many of the sites across the world, particularly in Northern Europe and America are vulnerable to the threat of ice. We’re really excited to be rolling out this new technology to support wind farm operators and owners to minimise damage, and maximise efficiency.#windpower #windenergy #windenergie #renewableenergy #pingmonitor #greenenergy #acousticsolutions",94,0,Ping,1mo,2022-06-07

"One of the least predictable causes of blade damage is lightning strikes. And the consequences can be catastrophic. A Ping Monitor will pick up this damage straight away, meaning it can be addressed as quickly as possible. Other methods of monitoring may not identify damage for months. For example, in the US our monitors picked up damage, and an alarm was sent to the user. It transpired there had been a +90kA strike which was later confirmed as can be seen in this image.

"Historically, damage to wind turbine blades would only be identified via inspections every 6, 12, 24 or 36 months, usually carried out via drones and ground-based cameras. This approach may be sufficient when damage propagates slowly. However, most unscheduled expensive blade corrective actions happen between blade inspections and are due to a sudden and accelerated deterioration of known minor defects or rapid propagation of new damages. Ping Monitors use acoustic sensing to identify damage, as soon as it occurs, ensuring you can act fast to limit consequences.#bladeengineer #windenergy #windturbine #engineering #engineers #renewableenergy #energyefficiency",33,0,Ping,9mo,2022-06-07

"""With COVID19 the rules have changed and games are shorter.

I have always struggled with cramping, especially late in games.

"""I was first introduced to PREPD through a friend who knew I was about to conduct a pre-Vuelta training camp in Andorra during the height of Summer in 2018. I had conducted my research on PREPD and knew what the supposed benefits were. However, going into the camp I didn’t explain to the athlete in detail what he could expect to experience. I wanted to trial PREPD without giving away what we were looking for from the product.To my amazement, everything PREPD expected the athlete to experience with the product, he was conveying the same messages back to me. Most notably, he was strong in the final hour of training. He commented that he didn’t feel the need to drink as often, and there were less bathroom stops during the long training sessions. At the same time, I was monitoring pre and post exercise weight and I was very pleased with the minimal amount of fluid loss experienced despite the high temperatures.""— Kevin Poulton, Professionally Renowned Australian Cycling CoachThere's not long left to join our EOI investment waitlist, don't miss your chance to get exclusive early access to our offer document!

"""I had a few players who were struggling with hydration. They would do all of the right things but still lost large amounts of fluid during a game and had issues with cramping. I wanted to look outside the box and see what else I could do to help these athletes. I came across PREPD in some studies and decided to give it a try. The biggest benefit my athletes found with PREPD was the reduction in fluid losses during a game.The benefits of consuming the PREPD Recover powder is that it contains the added protein. The added protein and leucine make it a great recovery drink as this will help with muscle repair and recovery post exercise as well as hydration. It is beneficial to have it all combined into one product as athletes don’t have to drink many different products to get the same benefit.""- Samantha Coppinger, AFL Western Bulldogs Sports Football Club Sports DietitianClick here to join the EOI investment waitlist - https://lnkd.in/ghTTwGyx#prepdhydration#readyprepdgo#poweredbyprepd#jointheprepdjourney",9,0,PREPD,4mo,2022-06-07
"Another reason to join the PREPD Crowd Funding Journey...PREPD is far more than ""just better hydration"" - all PREPD products contain therapeutic levels of prebiotics in the form of our unique Resistant Starch. While there are many different types of Resistant Starch, our research team have extensively tested a diverse range of resistant starches to identify the best one to drive fluid absorption.The Resistant Starch in PREPD can boost the body’s hydration effectiveness in the gut to absorb up to an additional 5L of fluid per day. In addition, the stimulation of the bacteria in the gut by Resistant Starches can enhance the absorption of micro-nutrients, such as calcium, and can also improve energy recovery, better immune system, nutrient utilisation and metabolism in the body.To learn about the PREPD crowdfunding click the link below👇 https://lnkd.in/ghTTwGyx.#prepdhydration#readyprepdgo#poweredbyprepd#jointheprepdjourney#crowdsourcedfunding",3,0,PREPD,4mo,2022-06-07

"With all this warm weather ahead of us, it seems like a good time to check in on our knowledge about dehydration! 🥵KEY FACT - A 2% drop in hydration means up to 30% drop in performance 🚨WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? - The typical athlete sweat rates range  from 1-3 litres per hour. This means that for most people, when exerting for an hour or more, fluid loss is likely to be near or over 2% of body mass loss 💦WITH PREPD - Your body will absorb up to 39% more liquid ensuring you are better hydrating so you can perform at a higher level, reduce the likelihood of soft tissue injuries and cramping + get a better night's sleep 💤",7,0,PREPD,9mo,2022-06-07

"It was on this day in 1926 that the foundation stone of the current Adelaide Railway Station was laid by the Premier John Gun (and the seeds were planted for the station’s historic renaissance almost a century later)!)Adelaide’s original railway station opened in 1856 with a single track between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, and was the first government-owned and operated steam railway in the British Empire. But it was the period between 1922-1930, under the leadership of Railways Commissioner William Alfred Webb, that the station we know today was designed and built.19 designs were submitted as the result of an architectural competition held in 1924 with local architects Daniel Garlick and Herbert Jackman, awarded the winning design. Construction cost an estimated £800,000 and almost bankrupted the state during the onset of the Great Depression, while keeping hundreds of construction workers in paid employment.The station soon became the epicentre of train travel in South Australia and a thriving place to shop and socialise with the concourse built to cater for long distance travellers as well as daily commuters. People flocked to experience its giant, American-style locomotives, as well as to dine at the Overland Dining Hall (now The Guardsman), buy sweets and tobacco, get their hair cut, visit the beauty parlour, send a telegram or have their baby weighed.Today approximately 230,000 commuters use the station every week (that’s 12 million commuters per year) and the station is a State Heritage Place and one of the finest remaining examples of neoclassical architecture in Australia.Photo credit: Image courtesy of the State Library of South Australia  [B 4898] - The western and southern (front) façades of the Adelaide Railway Station in 1928#AdelaideRailwayStation #Adelaide #SouthAustralia #History #MakingADifference #StateHeritage",254,0,RENEWAL SA,10mo,2022-06-07

"It can cost brokers up to 5x more to attract a new client than it does to keep hold of an existing one. That’s why it blows our mind that so many mortgage brokers focus more of their time on chasing new leads day in day out and don’t prioritise client retention, when it actually just comes down to 4 simple steps:--> Predicting which clients are more likely to leave by analysing how long they’ve been with you and their current interest rate --> Proactively repricing clients if their current rate can be discounted--> Generating refinancing leads from your existing trail book (because trust us, there’s plenty) and saving your clients even moreYou don't have to do all of this manually...Sherlok automates all of the above AT SCALE for you.

"Finding a better rate for your clients is your superpower as a broker to keep those clients happy and with you forever.So here are our top three tips on how you can get better reprice outcomes for your customers in the current market:--> Make sure the LVR is low – think below 80%--> Larger loans are getting a better discount --> Submit competitive offers that the lender actually sees as a threat – if it’s a big 4, don’t put a non-conforming loan in there as a comparisonBut most importantly, repricing hacks ONLY help if you’re actually making time to do it. Set a goal for how many clients you want to reprice each week, and make sure you hit it. Even if you just start by allocating 1 hour a week and build up from there. Short on time? That’s where Sherlok can help you. Brokers say  “I love how much time this already saves because I don’t need to go in and out of the different lender portals.”Sherlok does the heavy lifting for you from monitoring clients, researching and comparing rates and even saving you from having to talk to the lenders. #mortgagebrokers #clientretention #fintech",7,0,Sherlok Loans,2mo,2022-06-07

"Hey busy brokers! The Sherlok Retention Score is about to become your new best friend.Similar to a credit score, the Sherlok Retention Score is an algorithm that looks at a whole range of different parameters, and then produces a score for each loan in your trail book.​The higher the score, the higher the risk of losing that loan.

"Word is getting out! Sherlok founder Adam Grocke recently sat down with journalist Annie Kane – and the result is this brilliant piece in The Adviser Magazine.Says Adam: ""All we want to do is help brokers lower a client’s interest rate. It’s win-win-win. If it’s a repricing, the client wins, because they get a lower rate. The lender wins, because they keep the client. The broker wins, because they keep the client for longer [and don’t get clawed back].""If it’s a refinance, then we are helping connect that client automatically with their broker so they can have a conversation about what should happen next and ensure they’re in a loan that is in their best interest.""Check out the piece below 👇",6,0,Sherlok Loans,1yr,2022-06-07

His manager said he was doing ok but wondered why he didn’t talk and involve him more regularly.  His answer was “I thought that was my job — to take away all this crap from you and let you do your CEO thing. I thought you wanted me to be autonomous. I need autonomy.” He said sure, but you should cheat “and use my brain to help you”. So our CEO & Co-Founder, Ben Smit, invited Jean-Michel to an exclusive interview to learn more about the difference between alignment and autonomy, and why this is important in all teams. 𝙒𝙖𝙩𝙘𝙝 𝙞𝙩 𝙣𝙤𝙬: https://lnkd.in/g8KyEzG2#teamengagement #teamculture",4,0,Teamgage,1mo,2022-06-07

"70% of our disengagement is attributed, in some way, to managers.So what can we, as leaders, do to help?Regardless of what's being implemented at an organisational level, what platforms we're using, how many work from home days we're talking about, engagement is about us and our teams.We need to communicate on a team level to figure out what is going to work for us, not for the general community. What strategies work in a hospital, aren't necessarily going to work in a start-up company.We need to remember that it isn't just about what we'd prefer, either. It's about the people in our teams. They deserve the freedom and accountability that hybrid scheduling can offer.So sit down, with your teams and discuss what works for them.

"What is command and control management and why is it awful?What management style can we shift to which is better for everyone?Command and control is very similar to micro-management... You tell people what to do and how to do it. Every step of their journey must be approved and observed.Some managers think this is the only way to trust employees and see results...THEY ARE WRONG!This management style will never allow you to trust! It will choke your employees creativity and passion, leading to higher staff turnover!Then what can we try that will get results but not destroy our culture?Try coaching your employees instead!Actually build trust with your team by allowing freedom and accountability. Measure efficiency by results and allow employees to work in their own way.Make sure employees know you're approachable and can offer support when they need it. If they are struggling, they should feel confident to come to management for help.Discuss goals and outcomes with employees, then allow them to get you there.

Ask yourself: ➡️ Does the organisation have a high turnover of staff?➡️ Is there evidence of people feeling comfortable to speak up and raise issues?➡️ Do leaders listen and act on team feedback? People need to be treated with respect, kindness and fairness from the moment they are welcomed to the moment they leave.  Like we did with Damian Reed.

"How challenging it is to maintain your corporate culture when people work remotely?In this recent interview with Sven Smit from McKinsey & Company, he mentions that culture may be the factor people are most concerned about in the post-pandemic era. More than 70% of executives tell they expect to continue some form of hybrid remote work, where you allow full-time or part-time work from home for selected staff. Some companies are migrating training or related events to online models.Learn more about it ➡️ link in the comments#remotework #humanresources",7,0,Teamgage,10mo,2022-06-07

"Tucked away in an unassuming panel on the ground floor of TPG Telecom’s HQ is a nifty little device no bigger than a modem that is capable of producing extreme speeds and superior performance well beyond what its size might suggest.  Yesterday, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia, Tommi Uitto, joined our Chief Technology Officer, Giovanni Chiarelli and leaders from our network teams to demo a low latency, high capacity mmWave device capable of producing whopping 2Gbps speeds, 360 degrees to users around it - all without being visible to the eye.  To put the capability of the Nokia Airscale device into context, you could stream more than 400 HD movies simultaneously, all without any interruption to speed or performance! Innovations like these are paving the way for the future of indoor 5G sites, customised with a shroud design to ensure service providers like ours can deliver optimal 5G service into homes, businesses and workplaces without compromising interior design or aesthetics.  We are focused on building the smartest 5G mobile network in Australia, and the results from yesterday’s demo with our friends at Nokia for service providers show that by combining innovative engineering with smart network design, we are on track to achieve just that. #smarter5Gnetwork #mmWave #5G",490,0,TPG,3w,2022-06-07

"On Friday, we marked the start of National Reconciliation Week. This is a time for all Australians to learn about our shared histories, cultures and achievements, and to explore how each of us can contribute to achieving reconciliation in Australia.  Last year, we launched our first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) which serves as a roadmap to our organisation partnering with, and learning from, our First Nations communities about how we can embed respect and inclusivity into the way we work, and ultimately make a meaningful difference for our people, customers and wider community.  Driving many of the goals set out in our RAP is our employee network for First Nations peoples and allies, The Ngarra Network. This week, The Ngarra Network is encouraging our people to take a stand on important First Nations issues, learn how to become a good ally and put in the hard yards to make positive change.  We’re committed to having constructive conversations about our nation’s history and to seeking ways to move forward together as individuals, an organisation and more broadly as a nation.  Most importantly, Reconciliation Week asks us not just to think about things from a First Nations’ perspective for one week, but to put these values into practice every single day.  Hear from Yugamba and Kamilaroi man and Ngarra Network employee, Cameron Nichol, and more about progress on our RAP in our RedWire blog article here: https://lnkd.in/dnaJ8M6w  #NationalReconciliationWeek2022 #BeBraveMakeChange",31,0,TPG,1w,2022-06-07
"We have become the first major telco in Australia to launch GFast technology, enabling superfast download speeds of up to 1Gbps across our fibre-to-the-building (FTTB) network.  This means wholesale customers within our FTTB footprint can now access download speeds up to 10 times faster than those currently offered across NBN Co’s FTTB network.  How fast is 1Gbps? A Blu-Ray movie could be downloaded in about two minutes, while a HD TV episode could be downloaded in eight seconds! Our Group Executive Wholesale, Enterprise and Government, Jonathan Rutherford said, “We think the launch of GFast is a game-changer for our wholesale business and customers. We are not only offering some of the fastest broadband speeds available in Australia today, but we have a straight-forward pricing structure, which means it is easier than ever to deliver superfast broadband to customers.”  “The launch of GFast is an important part of TPG Telecom’s on-net strategy to increase the capability of our broadband assets and to get more customers onto our own infrastructure. This is allowing us to connect more homes and businesses with innovative technology solutions to help consumers and businesses thrive in the digital world.” Our GFast technology is now available in more than 2000 buildings across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, covering more than 230,000 premises, and with plans to upgrade our footprint in South Australia and Western Australia, we’re on track to reach more than 2,500 buildings over the next year.

In fact, last month we switched on nearly 160 5G sites – a number that no other carrier has achieved with a full upgrade like ours.  We are achieving big things here at TPG Telecom, which has only been made possible as a result of our teams working closely with partners like Vecta Labs and Site Pro 1 to deliver one of the most significant network transformation programs in such a short timeframe.  Thank you for your visit Paul Fletcher – we are so proud to have shown you firsthand our passion and commitment to stay at the forefront of network innovation to ensure we continue to support businesses in solving problems and meet consumers’ needs and expectations right across Australia.  #5G #innovation #smarter5Gnetwork",271,0,TPG,6mo,2022-06-07

"This morning, our CEO and Managing Director Iñaki Berroeta addressed leading telco CEOs and executives, policy makers and global technology experts at Australia’s top telecommunications conference – the annual Communications Day (CommsDay) Summit – in Sydney.  In his speech, Iñaki highlighted the need to reset Australia’s telco policy and regulatory framework to better enable telcos to deliver greater value and service to their customers. Turning towards competition, Iñaki emphasised the value of Australian telcos working together to pool assets and spectrum through network sharing agreements, and the domino effect this has on improving costs, infrastructure, service and reach, while also delivering greater choice, competition and connectivity for all Australians.  Iñaki concluded with a call upon NBN Co to work closer with industry to fulfil its original purpose: to provide universal broadband access for all Australians, no matter their means or socioeconomic situation. Predictability and cost certainty must be at the core of any NBN Co pricing proposal, so retailers like ours can pass on the benefits of connectivity to the homes and businesses who rely on it in a sustainable, reliable and affordable way.  You can read Iñaki’s full speech here: https://lnkd.in/gecWpTkH#CommsDaySummit2022 #telecommunications",259,0,TPG,1mo,2022-06-07

"Check out this awesome article on our Vodafone Red Wire blog written by tech journalist Trevor Long on the latest and greatest in 5G-enabled tech that was showcased at the world’s largest technology show, CES, in Las Vegas earlier this month. From hybrid working, to smart homes, cities and cars, and the ever-evolving world of the Internet of Things, Trevor covers it all. He writes, “While the enormous TVs, smart projectors and crazy gadgets (like pillows that detect your snoring and move you to stop it) grabbed some of the headlines, there was one important thing underpinning a huge number of the exhibits and innovations – connectivity.“Amid that connectivity discussion was the ever-present conversation about how the power of 5G mobile technology will be an enabler for a vast amount of innovation and gadgets over the years ahead.”#5G #CES2022 #technology #innovation",43,0,TPG,4mo,2022-06-07
"Queensland-based businesses and local councils are set for a big competitive boost when it comes to accessing cloud computing services with the launch of our new private cloud service region in Brisbane.For Moreton Bay Regional Council (our first customer on this newly launched region) the use of TPG Telecom’s private cloud services means it can tap into the benefits of on-premises IT services – including high bandwidth, low latency on-demand compute, and storage from highly secure data centres - without the capital costs typically associated with on-premise infrastructure and management. ""This brings enterprise-grade connectivity, competition and choice to businesses and councils throughout Queensland that traditionally have had to look further south for similar cloud services,” said Jeremy Howe, TPG Telecom General Manger, Commercial Enterprise and Government.“Not only do we think we have the best enterprise solutions in the market, but we offer our private cloud service for a flat, monthly fee which removes the headaches of bill shock that are often associated with variable charges in public cloud.”To find out more, check out our media release here: https://lnkd.in/gSPJee6s#privatecloud #enterprise #saas #cloud",99,0,TPG,2mo,2022-06-07

Our very own Group Executive Legal and External Affairs and chair of AMTA, Trent Czinner, joined Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, AMTA CEO Louise Hyland, and Deloitte Access Economics Partner John O'Mahony, to launch the report and speak about the explosive potential of 5G for unlocking next-level advances in technology, huge boosts in productivity, and smarter ways of living.The report, which was co-authored with Deloitte Access Economics, noted Australia has established itself as a global leader in 5G thanks to continued investment in essential infrastructure at an annual rate unmatched and often unrecognised.The modelling shows that if industry, government and business work together to drive 5G adoption, Australia’s GDP could increase by a whopping $67 billion by 2030 on the current trajectory. If 5G leadership and adoption was accelerated that number would increase to $94 billion by 2030!To find out more, you can read the full report here: https://lnkd.in/gGWYiz6i #5G #smarter5Gnetwork #MobileNationReport2022",178,0,TPG,2mo,2022-06-07

He said, “Customers deserve real choice in how and where they access broadband and mobile - and it needs to be on their terms: where, when, and in what form it best suits them.”#CommsDayCongress #telecommunications",209,0,TPG,2mo,2022-06-07

"Today is the International Day of the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and we have banded together with four of Australia’s leading telcos as part of the Telco Together Foundation Impact Hub to collaboratively tackle Domestic and Family Violence (DFV).  Technology can be a lifeline in a situation of DFV, but it can also be a tool for abuse and control, and with 8 in 10 people in Australia now using a smartphone, telcos like ours are often a first port of call for people experiencing DFV. With this comes great responsibility, and we recognise that collectively, we have the opportunity to make a real difference.  Iñaki Berroeta, TPG Telecom CEO and Managing Director, said “Domestic and family violence is a destructive force which causes untold harm in our society, and we all have a responsibility to help victim-survivors. At TPG Telecom, we have processes in place to support customers experiencing or fleeing abuse, and ten days’ domestic violence leave available for our employees. Collectively we can make a bigger impact and we stand together with other telcos to develop unanimous, industry-wide standards.” For the past year, we have been working hard to identify areas of collective action and responsibility within the industry that will have the greatest impact on reducing of domestic violence while also supporting victims/survivors. Together we have developed a DFV Action Plan Framework launching in February 2022, which will support more than 600 telcos across the world to apply a more informed, unanimous, and consistent framework to implement for their collective 70,000+ employees and millions of customers.You can find out more here: https://lnkd.in/gS9V2Y4M#InternationalDayoftheEliminationofViolenceAgainstWomen",70,0,TPG,6mo,2022-06-07

This type of relationship is all I want for my daughter Millie and I. This is what being a father means to me. Helping her, teaching her, challenging her and being there for her no matter what. I know my father worked tirelessly to have our special bond and that’s something I try and live up to every day.“Just after my very first Father’s Day in September I will be taking the rest of my parental leave from September through to December. I cannot wait to spend this time with Millie. Although with the lockdown in Sydney we won’t initially be able to do many of the things I had planned, just being able to spend this time with her and building an even stronger bond will be amazing.”Here at TPG Telecom, we recognise the important role that fathers play and are committed to creating a family inclusive workplace for all.#FathersDay #inclusion #Parentalleave #familyfriendlyworkplace",100,0,TPG,9mo,2022-06-07
