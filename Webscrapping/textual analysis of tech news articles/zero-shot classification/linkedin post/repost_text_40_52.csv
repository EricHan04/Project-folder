People increasingly expect information on food provenance to make more conscious purchasing decisions. Movements such as slow food, Fair Trade and growing awareness of the social and environmental impact of food production are making consumers care about how the food on their table was produced. The industry needs to get ahead of this consumer-driven trend and work to get labels on fresh food products so that consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions.https://lnkd.in/eac_bGga#food #retail #freshproduce #innovation #education",1,Kicker Communications,10mo,2022-06-07

I came over by myself to complete high school in Tasmania. My parents thought Tasmania was nice and small, so I wouldn’t have the chance to hang around many other Chinese people, because they really wanted me to learn English.After high school, I moved to Melbourne for uni. Once I got here, I liked how friendly the people were. The city reminds me a lot of Beijing, with its mixture of culture, art, and music. I think Sydney, being more fast-paced, feels like Shanghai.I majored in accounting because my mum used to be an accountant and she had a big influence on me. From her, I learned that accounting is the language of business. After graduating, I joined Nike—it was a big company, so I got to learn and see a lot. And not to mention the great employee discount!I eventually had a lot of friends come to me to ask for tax advice. So I started self studying, learned how to use Xero, and took steps to work in the public service accounting area. Around then, by coincidence, I also met one of my co-founders, who had just started his own accounting firm business.Despite being in the accounting world today, I wanted to be a singer when I was really young. I haven’t let go of that completely. Today, I actually go to my friend’s restaurant on Friday nights to play the guitar or keyboard and sing, in both Mandarin and English. I play a bit of jazz as well. I love jazz. It’s something different after working the whole week, a good release.As I look to the future, one of the milestones I want to achieve is to have a LUCA Plus invoice be the first e-invoice sent to Mars.

"We are proud to be able to support Disaster Relief Australia who are on the ground assisting with the flood relief efforts in Queensland and New South Wales. If you would like to get involved with DRA, please go to: https://lnkd.in/gVeGsCE #DisasterReliefAustralia #MitsubishiMotorsAustralia",29,"This is just a glimpse of the floods and the damage it has caused. The floods have been nothing but heartbreaking for so many communities. Our flood recovery in Queensland and New South Wales look like they will be our largest operational commitments to date.Our volunteers are currently in NSW, working alongside locals providing hands-on help including mould treatment, debris removal, rubbish removal, clearing access points and general clean-up. The mud and sludge left behind by the receding floodwater have gotten into literally everything. When we work together in operations like these, we can improve a homeowner’s ability to bounce back and restore the overall cohesion of the local community. We do this by mobilising one of Australia’s most valuable resources: Australian veterans. Events like the floods in Queensland and New South Wales demonstrate that they are needed more than ever.Flood recovery is challenging work. This is why Disaster Relief Australia is currently doing nationwide recruitment to build our capabilities and disaster relief teams with the skills and experience of every Australian veteran. New recruits will be working as a unit with other veterans and the defence and emergency services community to provide critical services to help communities recover and rebuild.To find out more click the link below.https://lnkd.in/gVeGsCE#Veterans #Volunteers #Service #purposedriven #nswfloods #qldfloods #military #DisasterReliefAustralia #BuiltToServe",1,Mitsubishi,2mo,2022-06-07
