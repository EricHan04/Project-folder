Overwhelmed by the amount of new (and old) tech available for #brokers these days? Adam Grockerecently chatted with Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia (MFAA) Groundbreakers about client retention. Check out his tips below on how to incorporate tech and automations into your broker business model 👇(link in the comments to read the article),4,"💬 When I was tackling client retention in my own brokerage, I called clients who’d left to ask for feedback.  Almost all of them said it wasn’t about their service, they just realised their rate wasn’t competitive now and took the path of least resistance, which was to go to the closest broker or the one they most recently heard of. And now people are shopping around online before going to a broker.Brokers need to continually question if there is a better way of doing this and what is the effort required to make the change. Great to chat with Mortgage and Finance Association of Australia (MFAA) about cracking the code to keeping clients👇Brokers should be using technology to take away the low dollar productive tasks and automate, but they need to be careful about how, and which, technologies they implement. It’s key that #MortgageBrokers: 👉 Understand where in the lifecycle their business is👉 Prioritise which software or technology is appropriate for where their business is at in the lifecycle👉 Don’t do everything at once. Start with the two or three technology tools that will give the business the highest impact for the lowest effort👉 Make sure their data is up to date and in a format that can be easily extracted to use in other tools(link in the comments to read the article)",1,Sherlok Loans,3h,2022-06-07
"“Sherlok’s data is based on old LVR data”... myth BUSTED 💥We can understand why brokers might assume that the Sherlok retention score is calculated from the original LVR of a property, because that’s the latest data THEY have on record. One of the biggest benefits of using Sherlok to action reprices is that you can get more accurate data than what you have on file – including the LVR. The Sherlok algorithm tracks capital growth rates (by region) and uses that to predict today’s LVR for the property. Got an assumption you want us to de-myth? Ask in the comments and we’ll get Adam to answer it (or bust it)!",10,"One of the key things with client retention is making sure you’ve got reliable figures for repricing.Having an accurate loan-to-value ratio makes all the difference. Where possible, Sherlok looks at today’s value of the property (using our algorithms that track the capital growth rates in each region) to establish today’s LVR, saving you significant admin time and getting you more accurate estimates.If the homeowner’s LVR is below 80%, they’re more likely to leave, and this will actually drive a better reprice outcome for your consumer.So you’ll have a much happier client, and they’ll stay with you for longer.I’m planning to film some more of these myth busters soon, so hit me with any questions you’ve got below 👇#MortgageBrokers",1,Sherlok Loans,1,2022-06-07

"Clean data is becoming more and more critical for brokers to stay competitive in the digital world. Trust us, a little bit of effort now will save you heaps of time and money down the track.  If you think your data is too messy to start cleaning up, think again!It’s never too late to start cleaning your data, even if you just focus on keeping your new data records as accurate as possible.",5,"Brokers, here’s how to *not* get overwhelmed by your data (it’s one of the most important assets you’ve got):✅ DO make sure the data you’re collecting is up-to-date and accurate❌ DON’T keep your data in a word file or random spreadsheet – store everything in fields in a CRM platform that allows you to export it to use elsewhere (using a consistent data-entry protocol)Why does this matter?

"“Sherlok just does bulk repricing”... myth BUSTED 💥Nope. We don’t believe whole-book repricing makes sense for the consumer, broker or lender. Intelligent repricing on the other hand… That’s what we DO believe in. Sherlok uses artificial intelligence to predict trail book churn and queue up the clients at risk or very high risk of leaving for their broker to reprice in a single-click through the Sherlok platform.  Brokers can dial their repricing activity up or down depending on how busy they are – they’re ALWAYS in control of which loans in their trailbook get repriced. Got an assumption you want us to challenge us to de-myth? Ask it in the comments and we’ll get Adam to answer it (or bust it)!",2,"Okay, so I’m tackling the topic of intelligent repricing today (and every day…😂). Do you know what the propensity of churn in your trail book is? Understanding this is KEY to repricing the customers who need it the most👇 Sherlok #MortgageBroking #MortgageBrokers #ArtificialIntelligence",1,Sherlok Loans,1mo,2022-06-07
"“Unless your data is clean you can’t use Sherlok”... myth BUSTED 💥We know a lot of #brokers have messy databases and don’t worry, we get it. If your data isn’t 100% clean, it’s okay. Some brokers only have about 60-80% of their loan book that can be imported into Sherlok initially, but that will still save them heaps of time on client retention 🙌 🎉Got an assumption you want us to challenge us to de-myth? Ask it in the comments and we’ll get Adam to answer it (or bust it)!",5,"Is your database the weak link in your client retention efforts? No shade to brokers (clean data’s an issue for every industry), but what % of your database do you think is actually up-to-date? If you’re seeing more trail book churn than you’re comfortable with, your database might be something you need to tackle – even if you just start by making sure your new data is captured in a clean way. As for your old data, Sherlok can actually help clean up your database over time (skip to 0:25 to find out how)  🙌",1,Sherlok Loans,2w,2022-06-07
Hear more about the journey of how Sherlok’s founder Adam Grocke took a problem plaguing all #MortgageBrokers (himself included) – trail book drop off – and created a game-changing client retention tool.The interview really captures the passion driving our mission to make brokers the hero - it’s worth having a listen. Check out his interview with Dexter Cousins on the Fintech Chatter Podcast 👇,8,"This is the first time I’ve shared my start up journey. A massive thanks to Dexter Cousins for having me on Fintech Chatter Podcast As a mortgage broker that was seeing trail book drop off and you couldn't figure out how to tackle it. Where do you start? Which clients do you contact first? How do you know what rate they should be on compared to what they're on now? there were no tools to help with this which is why I created Sherlok. It's been one wild ride so far with some much support from our broker community. The next 12 months is going to be even better and we can't wait to see broker growing and benefiting from using Sherlok.Pushing against the norm, going out of your comfort zone and taking risks are the hardest things to do in life. Its not that I’m braver, unique or any different to others, I’ve just managed to surround myself with amazing people and I’ve actually taken the first step (which is the hardest until you take a second).Have a listen :) Links in comments below  #startup #people",1,Sherlok Loans,3mo,2022-06-07

People are time poor and most likely skimming their inbox.👉 Sometimes an email alone won’t cut it >>> Send them an SMS too that warns them there’s something important landing in their inbox that needs their action.These tips apply to pretty much ANY service-based business.What else would you add?

Not sure how to have a conversation with your clients about rising interest rates? There’s some great tips in this video 👇,3,"Everyone’s talking about interest rates rising, and I know brokers are already fielding calls about it. Here’s how you can get on the front foot with your clients:1. Decide what retention activity you’re going to do on a daily or weekly basis (e.g. calling clients for a conversation) 2. Block out a daily or weekly slot in your calendar as non-negotiable retention client contact time3. Identify the five clients you’re going to contact each day/week. Then identify the next five, and the next five, and so on This is your chance to be the trusted advisor that your clients need right now.

Another Southern Angels portfolio company making great strides…,14,"We are delighted to announce a AU$5.4 million raise to ready our LGR5 CAR-T program for advanced #colorectalcancer for a #clinicaltrial. The financing was strongly supported by current shareholders, board and management and attracted new institutional and impact investors including a cornerstone investment from the Minderoo Foundation. Dr Steve Burnell, CEO of Minderoo Foundation’s Collaborate Against Cancer Initiative, commented: “We are pleased to accelerate the development of breakthrough therapies such as CAR-T against solid tumours. Carina’s program is closely aligned with our strategy that is driving more personalised care, and our mission to make cancer a treatable, non-lethal disease.” Carina’s CEO Dr Deborah Rathjen said: “We warmly welcome our new investors and thank our existing investors who have also supported this financing. “At Carina Biotech, we are focused on our goal of creating a future that defeats cancer. The LGR5 CAR-T cell for advanced colorectal cancer is a great place to start, given this cancer’s very poor prognosis and rising incidence, particularly in younger people. “We know that colorectal cancer is the deadliest cancer for young Australians. We also know that there has been a nearly 190% increase in colorectal cancer cases in adolescents and young people in Australia over the last 30 years. These trends are seen internationally as well.“This is a lethal cancer for all Australians, young and old, that we want to be able to treat.” Carina’s approach to institutional and impact investors was undertaken by MST Financial. Peter Wilson of wilsonemmett acted as financial adviser to Carina.#immunotherapy #immunooncology #CAR-T #cancerresearchhttps://lnkd.in/gpN9YNWE",1,Southern Angels,9mo,2022-06-07

The collaboration is off to a great start with Carina having already successfully inserted an AdAlta i-body into a CAR-T cell with functional cancer killing capability.”AdAlta’s CEO, Tim Oldham commented, “We believe that by combining our i-bodies with Carina's world-class CAR-T platform, we can make this important new therapeutic approach accessible to more patients and a greater range of cancers than is possible today.

🙌,0,"“To get 1 million people employed in tech sector jobs by 2025, we need an additional 286,000 workers to join the sector.” - Tech Council of AustraliaThis is exactly why The Startmate Fellowship exists. To create net gain of talent. And to make technology the #1 contributor to local GDP. 🚀 To date 72% of our women alumni are now in jobs - having translated their skills and careers from outside of the startup world in (i.e. we have helped 175+ women land their dream role in the tech industry, we are very much just getting started). We are seeking to create a net gain. Through fast-tracking your skills translation + network build. The more alumni we have, the faster the flywheel turns. We are building a platform to be able to serve 100s of tech companies in Australia & New Zealand, and be able to launch multiple programs a year at scale to further accelerate this net gain.

"Before today's political polarization over climate change, and even before the American Civil War, American scientist Eunice Foote conducted a simple experiment that uncovered the root cause of today's climate change crisis 🌏Foote has played a fundamental role in our understanding of global climate change. However, despite her unambiguous warning regarding basic science 165 years ago, the earth's surface continues to warm. There is no better time than now, to speed up your sustainability journey🌱#womeninscience #climatechange #sustainability",5,"Eunice Foote was a remarkable woman; in 1856 (ALMOST 170 YEARS AGO) she published the findings of her study on the effect of carbonic acid gas (ie carbon dioxide gas) on the absorption of the sun's rays. She concluded that :""An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature"". Eunice Foote performed a simple experiement using a series of glass bell jars; one set contained air the other carbon dioxide. Using a simple orthogonal design she exposed these to light from the sun (shaded and unshaded). For those not keen to read the actual paper here is the key bit of text ...""The highest effect of the sun’s rays I have found to be in carbonic acid gas. One of the receivers was ﬁlled with it, the other with common air, and the result was as follows:[This data table shows temperature in degrees F]-----------------------------------------------  In common air       | In carbonic acid gas  ----------------------|------------------------In shade |    In sun   |    In shade   |   In sun ----------|-----------|--------------|----------  80        |        90     |           80      |      90      81        |        94     |           84      |    100  80        |        99     |           84      |    110  81        |      100     |           85      |    120----------------------------------------------- The receiver containing the carbonic acid [ie carbon dixoide] gas became itself much heated - very sensibly more so than the other -and on being removed, it was many times as long in cooling. An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature; and if as some suppose, at one period of its history the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at resent, an increased temperature from its own action as well as from increased weight must have necessarily resulted.On comparing the sun’s heat in different gases, I found it to be in hydrogen gas, 104° ; in common air, 106°; in oxygen gas, 108° ; and in carbonic acid gas, 125°.""Apart from a shout-out to all the wonderful #womenandgirlsinscience this pioneer also deserves a special place in our thoughts as one of the early pioneers who revealed the fundamental physical principles that drive our current concerns about global climate change.

The curved rails, the sounds, the lights, the thump of the servos as they smack the steel ball, the artwork... or maybe a combination of all of the above ?Blender is a great tool for rapid prototyping game concepts. I wanted to see how a pinball-inspired experience might look and work on our Voxon Photonics VXR prototype. It took me about an hour to build this physics-based simulation and about 2 minutes to export it to an OBJ sequence to run on the VXR Display.I think a circular pinball table could be fun. The game area could even scroll vertically, and being digital, could morph from one structure to another.  The VXR is our largest working prototype display, at 46cm in diameter and 12cm deep, running at 30 VPS. It has maximum rendering output of around 3 Billion Voxels / Sec and is powered by an Intel Corporation 11th Gen Core i9 processor.

https://lnkd.in/gQtuyvxt,7,"It's hard to ignore all these speculative articles about what the Metaverse will be. There appears to be no shortage of ""experts"" on hand, each with their own take on what the future has in store. I'm definitely NOT a metaverse expert, but I do think about the future of technology a lot, and what I find hard to ignore is the striking similarity to where we were back in 1990, when the last ""Metaverse"" was being imagined. The infrastructure was all in place, PCs, modems, networks, all globally connected and awaiting the next ""big thing"". Then along came AOL, Prodigy and Compuserve, each with their own version of a digital utopia.... where, for a monthly subscription you could gain access to vast repositories of news, entertainment, sport and forums, and best of all, it was neatly arranged, and curated so you didn't get lost.This ""walled garden"" approach was hugely successful...at least for a while...  Eventually, however, people decided that life inside the walled garden was a bit sterile, and lacking in diversity, and they started leaving to explore the vast expanse that lay outside it.  That vast expanse became the internet, a place that connected people of all ages, races, religions, nationalities, and it allowed those people to express themselves creatively in any way they wished. Of course, with that freedom there came bad things, viruses, internet fraud, spam and criminals who hid in the shadows doing nasty things. But..... the internet adapted, and tools were created to keep people safe. So here we are again, 30 years later, and the next generation of infrastructure exists with which to build the next metaverse, which popular media will tell you is an immersive world where you can do anything, be anyone, go anywhere, and all the time have access to all the information in the world. Facebook, (aka Meta) has now made it clear that they are building the first walled garden, just like AOL did 30 years ago. It will probably be really popular for a while....until Epic or Microsoft or Google or Snapchat launch their version. People will flit from one metaverse to another, seeking out the best bits of each. Photoreal vs cartoon, augmented vs immersive, business vs pleasure....My best guess is that 10 years from now, we will still have the internet, but there will be multiple ways to explore it, including VR, AR, Mixed Reality, Autostereoscopic displays, regular 2D displays, volumetric displays and even just audio. There will be numerous social media, gaming, sporting and business platforms, each with their own ""Monoverse"".The internet exists as it is today because it has evolved to suit the individual needs of over 4.6 Billion people. It's an incredible thing... and whilst it will keep evolving (better coding standards, increases in bandwidth, IOT integration, greener infrastructure, AI, better searching, better security, blockchain, virtualized everything) , I think it will remain largely the same, which is a good thing!",1,Voxon,7mo,2022-06-07
