Rare space object captured by Hubble
The Hubble Space Telescope has snapped a picture of a rare phenomenon: bright blue jets of gas blasting out from a dust cloud.
Known as a Herbig-Haro object, this image shows the genesis of a star system. In the centre, a baby star is being born, spinning as it coalesces out of gas and dust. As it whirls around, the star shoots out two streams of hot, ionised gas from its north and south poles.
This is a rare thing to see: firstly, because the jets only spew out of an infant star for 10-20,000 years, which is barely a blink on the cosmic timescale of the universe; and secondly, because the light is obscured by the dust, and so we can only really spot close-by Herbig-Haro objects from within our own galaxy.
Only 111 of such objects are known. This one is 1,300 light-years away in the constellation of Orion, and was captured by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3.
Stressed tuatara
According to a study published in New Zealand Journal of Zoology, tuatara may be stressed from being around people.
