Adelaide coach Matthew Nicks is optimistic Paul Seedsman's AFL career won't be prematurely ended by concussion.
Seedsman has been placed on the Crows' inactive list and won't play a game this season amid ongoing effects from a concussion last December.
But Nicks says the 30-year-old, who finished third in Adelaide's club champion award last year, is determined to play again next season.

"I am optimistic he will play," Nicks told reporters on Friday.
" ... He wants to come back and play footy, it's just that challenge is going to be a physical and a reasonably emotional ride for him over the next six months."
Nicks said it was vital Seedsman "has a healthy life after footy".
"Seedo is a fantastic member of our footy club, he is a fantastic person, so the last thing we want to do is put him at risk and the last thing he wants to do is put himself at risk," Nicks said.
"He is progressing well, he's in a good headspace at the moment.
"But it's going to take time to get his body physically back to where he needs to be and then the mental challenge of coming out after a concussion like he has had.
"It's unfortunate for this year. But we're not going to push him.
"We will do everything we can to make sure we time that right and get him back for next season because he is so important to our group on and off the field."
