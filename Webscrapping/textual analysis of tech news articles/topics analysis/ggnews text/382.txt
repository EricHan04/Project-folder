An eighth case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has been confirmed in NSW.
The fully vaccinated person had recently been in southern Africa and arrived in Sydney on flight SQ231 from Singapore on Sunday, November 28.
“The person has been in hotel quarantine since arriving, as required under the NSW public health order,” NSW Health said in a statement tonight.

“NSW Health is requesting every person who was on flight SQ231 from Singapore to Sydney on 28 November to immediately get their first COVID-19 PCR test if not already completed and isolate until they receive a negative result. Under the public health order, they are also required to get a COVID-19 PCR test on day 6 (4 December 2021) after arriving in NSW.”
“All travellers arriving in NSW who have been in South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini and Malawi during the 14-day period before their arrival in NSW must enter hotel quarantine for 14 days, irrespective of their vaccination status.
“Anyone who has already arrived in NSW who has been in any of the eight African countries within the previous 14 days must immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days, and call NSW Health on 1800 943 553.”
NSW Health confirmed a seventh case of the Omicron variant of the virus earlier on Thursday, in a child who is too young to get vaccinated. The child’s parents have also tested positive to COVID-19 and urgent genomic sequencing is under way to confirm whether they also have the variant.
