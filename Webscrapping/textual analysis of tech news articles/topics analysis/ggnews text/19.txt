Family matters
We’ve already had Novak Djokovic facing a former coach in an opponent’s corner this week.
Now there will be a similar dynamic for Rafael Nadal when he takes on the Toni Nadal-coached Felix Auger-Aliassime in the fourth round on Sunday.
Thirteen-time Roland-Garros champion Nadal was clinical once again on Friday, surrendering just nine games to Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp to soar into the second week.
The 21-time Grand Slam winner will next meet ninth seed Auger-Aliassime for a place in the quarter-finals and in an intriguing plot twist, the Canadian has Nadal's uncle and long-time mentor on his coaching team.
“I don't know if I need insight on how Rafa plays, to be honest. I think we all know what he does well,” smirked Auger-Aliassime on Friday, following his victory over Filip Krajinovic.
