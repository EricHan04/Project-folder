An Adelaide café has turned into a campaign stop for opposition leader Anthony Albanese as he caught up with former prime minister Julia Gillard the day before Australians have their deadline with democracy.
As The Mandarin exclusively flagged earlier this week, Gillard travelled from her current London residence to join the Labor campaign.
Gillard and Albanese both served in the federal parliament the last time there was a minority government, which is a prospect being entertained by various commentators about the outcome of this election.
This is based on polling results that have neither the Coalition nor the Australian Labor Party getting more than 40% of the primary vote.
Other senior Labor figures joined the two for a coffee, including shadow foreign minister Penny Wong.
This is the first time Gillard has been seen on the campaign trail, but she did appear in Labor party communications endorsing Albanese’s run for the top job.
A fundraising email sent by the Labor party just 10 days ago had Gillard endorsing Albanese’s work in helping get her government’s legislative agenda through the parliament when the votes of crossbenchers needed to be secured.
“I have known Anthony for nearly 30 years (yes – that long!). We both look pretty different to what we did back then… but what strikes me about Anthony is what hasn’t changed. The same values of decency and integrity. The same priorities of fairness and opportunity. The same proven ability to lead and to deliver on what matters,” Gillard said.
“During the last Labor government, Anthony had the job of getting critical legislation passed through the Parliament – something he delivered on 570 times. Think of all the big reforms we did – the National Disability Insurance Scheme, better schools funding, paid parental leave – Albo got them all through.”
