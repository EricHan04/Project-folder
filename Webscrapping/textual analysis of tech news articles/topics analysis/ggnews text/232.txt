Native to the Netherlands, I have lived in Australia for 15 years and am an associate professor in maritime archaeology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. I am a scientific diver, drone pilot, and cultural heritage advocate.
I have undertaken archaeological research on sites and collections dating from the ancient to historical periods in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, North America and Australia.
My research interests focus on the archaeology of ships and seafaring (including the archaeological remains of Western Australia’s early European shipwrecks), technology advancement and transfer, culture contact and communication at sea, Indigenous agency in maritime industries, ship construction, seamanship, archaeobotany, archaeometallurgy, dendro-archaeology, and 3D modelling & photogrammetry.
