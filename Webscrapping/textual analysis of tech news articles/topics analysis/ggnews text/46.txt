The 2022 season kicked off with the ATP Cup and a few more tournaments are scheduled to take place ahead of the Australian Open. One of them is the Adelaide International, which will take place from January 3-9.
The men's competition isn't as high-profile as the women's given it's an ATP 250 event.
The Adelaide International was first held in 2020, during which there was an exciting semifinal clash between Andrey Rublev and Felix Auger-Aliassime. Both players took a set in a tiebreak before the Russian prevailed in the third. Rublev then beat South African qualifier Lloyd Harris 6-3, 6-0 to win the tournament.
The men's tournament was not held last year but will be held twice in 2022, with the first starting January 3.
Since several top players including Daniil Medvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas are participating in the ATP Cup, this year's Adelaide International does not have many big names.
