Telecommunications company TPG Telecom has launched a new 10Gbps Fast Fibre internet for business and enterprise customers, covering 137,000 businesses in metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and Canberra.
“The launch of our new 10Gbps service will be ideal for businesses like banks and financial institutions that use high-speed data links for real-time fraud detection, educational institutions to support increased use of high-definition video and online learning tools, or media and broadcasting bodies requiring high-speed links for remote production and live streaming,” says TPG Telecom head of product enterprise, government, and wholesale Tom Sykes.
Customers can leverage TPG Telecom’s 10Gbps Fast Fibre product to allocate bandwidth for multiple services.
Sykes says service change can be made in real-time through the telco’s Frontier Customer Portal and support, available 24/7.
“With TPG Telecom’s 10Gbps Fast Fibre service, you can extend your high-speed network from the office and into the cloud. This is essential for any business looking to make the most of workforce collaboration and increased productivity through cloud-based apps.”
The launch of 10Gbps Fast Fibre is available for $2,499 per month (ex-GST).
TPG Telecom will deploy hardware upgrades at metro locations to deliver 10Gbps speed across its network.
In 2020, TPG Telecom finished its 10 gigabit fibre network project in Adelaide. The project, called Ten Gigabit Adelaide, was started in 2018 to provide services for businesses.
