Plans have been unveiled for a new $20m ice arena and rock-climbing facility to be built in Marion.
After the initial proposal of a two-rink arena was put to the City of Marion in 2018 and later denied, the council have now agreed on a smaller development that they believe is more suited to the area.
The proposal, which is now out for public discussion, will see the build of a state-of-the-art ice-skating rink and a range of rock-climbing walls including international competition walls, recreational climbing and bouldering and themed climbing walls as well as a kiosk and children’s café.
Once completed, the arena will boast an international standard ice rink with a seating capacity of up to 450 spectators. The rink is expected to be the home of South Australia’s Australian Ice Hockey League team, Adelaide Adrenaline, possibly in time for the 2024 season.
Ice Rinks Adelaide will serve as the main operator of the arena with the current residents of the building, the Marion Croquet Club, being advised on the decision. If the proposal is signed off, works would begin towards the latter part of this year.
The Ice Arena is the newest SA venture by Melbourne-based construction company, The Pelligra Group, as they continue to invest in infrastructure around the state. The proposed 42-year lease will join the growing number of projects for the group in SA which will include the new training facility and home ground for the Adelaide Crows.
The plan also included discounted rates for the facility to Marion residents should they wish to use any of the amenities within the arena.
The Ice Rink will be located on the 10,000sqm land of 262 Sturt Road, Marion which is currently classified as Community Land, hence why it has been put to public consultation. Mayor of Marion, Kris Hanna, came out on Facebook today calling for local residents to have their say on the proposal.
