World no. 20 Felix Auger-Aliassime has been the first player confirmed for the inaugural Adelaide Internation between January 12-18, 2020. Serving as the last preparation for the Australian Open, Adelaide should bring a strong field of players at Memorial Drive that is going to get a roof by mid-December.
Felix has made incredible progress in the last couple of seasons and has stood as the leader of the new generation born around 2000, already reaching three ATP finals in 2019 and winning more than 30 matches on the Tour. Kicking off the season from just outside the top-100, Felix needed some time to find the desired form, leaving a couple of early exits behind him and advancing into the title match at the ATP 500 event in Rio de Janeiro, losing to Laslo Djere but earning points to find himself in the top-60.
In Miami, Auger-Aliassime became one of the youngest Masters 1000 semi-finalists, mastering another surface and standing on the verge of entering the final after being a break up against John Isner in both sets, only to lose in two tie breaks.
In Lyon, Benoit Paire halted the Canadian in the title match and Felix was in another one in Stuttgart, suffering a tight loss to Matteo Berrettini and showing his skills on grass as well. The results were not there in recent months and Felix is trying to change that in the last events of the season before attacking even higher goals in 2020, including Adelaide as one of his first stops of the new campaign.
"I am really looking forward to playing in Adelaide in January," Auger-Aliassime said. "I have always enjoyed visiting Australia, but I haven't visited Adelaide before, so I am thrilled to be playing the first Adelaide International.
I have heard that the climate in Adelaide is very similar to Melbourne, so I think that this tournament will be the perfect preparation for the Australian Open."
