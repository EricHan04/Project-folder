Blink, and you may have missed the tennis off-season.
The ATP and WTA Tours kick off their 2022 seasons this week and they are doing it in a big way with six events featuring almost every big name in the game.
There is so much going on this week, it’s a dream start to 2022 (for tennis). Here’s what you need to know:
What to Watch: Canadians all over Australia
ATP Cup
Team Canada will look for redemption after their disappointing Davis Cup performance by kicking off the season at another team competition, the ATP Cup.
This time, the Canadians are sending their A-team, with both Félix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov in action along with Brayden Schnur and Steven Diez, who competed for Canada at the Davis Cup in the fall.
Things did not get off to a great start for the Canadians in Sydney, as they were beaten 3-0 by the United States in the first tie of the group stage.
Auger-Aliassime lost a three-set heartbreaker to Taylor Fritz, while Schnur lost to John Isner in the other singles match. Shapovalov, who is still recovering from a recent bout of COVID-19, only played doubles in that first tie alongside Auger-Aliassime. The pair lost in straight sets.
Next up for Canada is Great Britain on Monday night. Germany, led by world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, is the fourth team in the very challenging Group C. Canada will need big wins in both of their remaining ties if they hope to reach the semi-finals.
While the ATP Cup boasts a star-studded field, with seven of the world’s Top 10 and 14 of the Top 20 in action, the biggest names have struggled so far, with Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Casper Ruud and Matteo Berrettini all losing their opening matches.
HUGE start of season for Ugo Humbert who managed to beat World No.2 Daniil Medvedev 6-7 7-5 7-6 at ATP Cup. Russia finally beat France 2-1.
