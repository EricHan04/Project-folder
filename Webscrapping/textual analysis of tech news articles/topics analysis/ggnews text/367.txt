The Federal Government will fund a $34 million research centre in Adelaide with the aim of “reinforcing the future of aged care” in Australia – three years after it was first recommended.
Flinders University’s Aged Care Centre for Growth and Translational Research, to open next year, will initially focus on four key areas:
dementia care,
restorative care and rehabilitation,
mental health and wellbeing, and
social isolation.
Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Richard Colbeck (pictured), dubbed it a “big step forward” for aged care research.
“The Morrison Government is supporting the aged care sector to make improvements across workforce capability, care quality and effectiveness. “To do that, it’s important for the Government to back innovation and accelerate the uptake of new technologies and research to benefit our ageing population,” he said.
The Aged Care Workforce Industry Council (ACWIC) says it is “delighted” with the move; CEO Louise O’Neill called it a “significant achievement” in response to the aged care workforce strategy A Matter of Care.
“The Translational Research Centre has a key role in driving improvement in aged care service delivery and workforce capability. “It is great to see that Flinders University will host the Translational Research Centre and we look forward to working with them to support the development of evidence based practical tools and resources translated from targeted aged care research,” she said.
The announcement comes three years after it was recommended as part of the 2018 Aged Care Workforce Report’s 14 strategic actions.
