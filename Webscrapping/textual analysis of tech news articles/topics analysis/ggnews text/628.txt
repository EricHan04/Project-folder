Former News Corp editor lands at JP Media
Adelaide communications and creative agency JP Media has appointed former Sunday Mail Editor Megan Lloyd to head up a new corporate communications division.
Lloyd, who spent 14 years at News Corp before leaving the Sunday Mail in 2013, has worked in public relations for the last nine years with a number of high-profile companies.
Her first comms gig after exiting journalism came with the ASC in Osborne. Following her resignation from that role in 2014, she went on to work with Holden during their exit from Elizabeth and then ElectraNet during their planning for the $2.28 billion SA-NSW interconnector.
She also sits on the board of SA Rugby.
Her new position will see her responsible for the communications of JP Media’s most high-profile clients, including Nokia, the Department for Trade and Investment, the Adelaide Central Market Authority and Charter Hall.
JP Media General Manager Daniel Crago said the appointment “opens a number of new opportunities” for the agency, which is currently moving from Cinema Place to Waymouth Street.
“Her vast experience and proven track record in corporate communications and issues management, as well as her media background brings significant depth of service to our clients,” he said.
JP Media also this week announced the hiring of Sweat Senior PR Manager Alison Hassel as Head of PR and Communications.
Hassel moved to Sweat in 2019 after nearly three years with the South Australian Tourism Commission and five years on and off with Zoos SA.
Her client responsibilities at JP Media now include the Adelaide Fringe, Mighty Kingdom and the Adelaide Economic Development Authority.
Crago touted Hassel as an “integrated communications expert” with a “history of delivering successful, large-scale PR campaigns”.
Earlier this month, Emmanuel Cavaleri, formerly Marketing Communications Coordinator at Society, also made the move to join JP Media.
