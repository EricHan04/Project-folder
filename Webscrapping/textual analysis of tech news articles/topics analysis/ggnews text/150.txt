The 2022 Hostplus SANFL League fixture has been updated, with Port Adelaide’s final two home games of the season relocated due to construction work at Alberton Oval.
With work to begin soon on new coaches’ boxes and media and broadcast facilities ahead of Port Adelaide’s inaugural AFLW season, this weekend’s clash between Port Adelaide and Glenelg will be the final SANFL match at Alberton Oval in 2022.
Port Adelaide’s Round 15 match against West Adelaide will therefore now be played at Hisense Stadium and is rescheduled to Friday, July 15, starting at 7:40pm.
Then in Round 16, Port Adelaide’s match against Central District will be played on Saturday, July 23 under lights at Maughan Thiem Kia Oval at 7:40pm.
The fixture for Round 19 of the Hostplus SANFL League, the final round of home-and-away matches, will be confirmed closer to the weekend of Saturday August 20, with finals beginning on Sunday August 28.
