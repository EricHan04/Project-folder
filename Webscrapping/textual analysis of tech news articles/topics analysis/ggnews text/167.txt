South Adelaide stunned top-of-the table North Adelaide with a vital two-point win at Flinders University Stadium.
Desperate to stay in touch with the top five, the Panthers did exactly that when midfielder-turned-makeshift forward Ben Heaslip kicked his third goal approaching the 22nd minute of the final term.
It was the only goal kicked in the final half-an-hour as the hosts paid tribute to former captain Keegan Brooksby in his 100th SANFL League match.
South coach Jarrad Wright would have been delighted with the resilience of his men given they appeared set to squander their hard-earned 27-point lead after Heaslip’s second early in the second term.
Despite North hitting the front after Will Combe’s neat set shot in 26th minute of the third term, South found a way to keep their season alive and bank their fifth win of 2022.
Experienced Panthers defender Joseph Haines was outstanding with 29 disposals and six marks while Fraser Turner (25 disposals), Oliver Davis (22 disposals) and Hayden Sampson (20 disposals) worked hard through the midfield.
Former West defender Elliot Dunkin relished his role further up the field with 24 disposals, often constructive through the corridor while Brooksby had 16 possessions and four clearances in his milestone match.
North trio Harrison Wigg (34 disposals), Aaron Young (29 disposals) and Campbell Combe (26 disposals) were again high among their team’s best performers, particularly Wigg, who is firming as a contender for the Magarey Medal.
Roosters captain Alex Spina tallied 23 disposals in defence while ruckman Mitch Harvey finished with 11 disposals and three clearances in his 150th SANFL League match.
