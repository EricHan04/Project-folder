Vodafone's creative account is out for pitch in Australia, with incumbent VMLY&R dropping out.
The telco says this follows last year’s $15 billion merger with TPG Telecom which brought together brands including Vodafone, TPG, iiNet and felix.
WPP’s Hogarth will remain Vodafone’s preferred production partner and Wavemaker media-buying partner.
However, the 18-month creative partnership with VMLY&R Australia has come to a "natural conclusion".
The Vodafone and VMLY&R partnership centred around the You Rule campaign which was conceived and produced during lockdown.
The You Rule platform led to Vodafone’s highest brand consideration score and record high advertising recognition scores, and to improving customer advocacy for the brand.
Thomas Tearle, CEO of VMLY&R Australia: “We are incredibly proud of the results we have achieved and impact we have had on Vodafone since we started working with the brand in March last year.
"We would like to thank Adam (Slattery) and his team for giving us the opportunity to collaborate, and we look forward to seeing the next evolution of the Vodafone brand as it moves forward in the era of 5G.”
VMLY&R has decided not take part in the new creative pitch.
Adam Slattery, general manager brand & commercial at Vodafone, says the pitch will start this month.
“With the strength of the merged group behind us, we’re excited to unlock even more potential for Vodafone,” says Slattery.
“We’re looking for a creative partner who can help us in the next phase of brand and campaign development.
“The partnership with VMLY&R Australia has been great, and together we have set the foundation for greater brand success but it’s time for a different model.”
