The pros on the WTA and ATP tours are back on court for 2022. Doubles Take looks at the action leading up to the Australian Open.
THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT
Canada has been knocking on the door at the international team events on the men’s side for the past few years now.
At the just-completed ATP Cup, the squad kicked it open in a major way.
Led by Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, the nation won its first men’s team competition, beating Spain in the final. Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov each picked up some huge wins in singles, while also showing they could be a force on the doubles court. After dropping their first rubber against the U.S., they bounced back with a win over Grand Slam champions Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury of Great Britain. Maybe even more impressive was their semifinal win over Russia, when the young Canadians clinched the tie with a match tiebreak win over Daniil Medvedev and Roman Safiullin.
Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov didn’t have to play doubles in the final against Spain after sweeping the two singles contests. Given their performances over the week, though, they definitely would have been up to the task.
QUEEN OF THE SWEEP
There’s starting off a season strong and there’s doing what Ashleigh Barty just accomplished at the Adelaide International 1 tournament.
The world No. 1, playing her first tournament since last year’s US Open, dropped only one set on her way to the singles title. And she was equally impressive on the doubles side: Teaming up with her compatriot Storm Sanders, the duo defeated Darija Jurak Schreiber and Andreja Klepac, the third seeds, for the victory. It’s the third doubles title of Sanders’ career, while Barty earned her third singles-doubles sweep, having accomplished the feat in Malaysia in 2017 and Stuttgart last year.
