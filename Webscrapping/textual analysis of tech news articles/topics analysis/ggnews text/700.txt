A "third-party routing issue" has been blamed for an outage that saw thousands of TPG users prevented from accessing a number of key Microsoft products today.
Around 10am, TPG users reported being unable to access communication platforms including Teams, Office 365 and Outlook.
Global outage tracking website DownDetector listed thousands of reports of issues across the three programs about 9.50am AEST.
Reported issues peaked at 10am on the site and had subsided by midday.
