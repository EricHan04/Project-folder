A four-goal final term was enough for Glenelg to defeat West Adelaide by 20 points in Round 10 of the U18 Torrens University Cup at Hisense Stadium.
Trailing by three points at the final change, the Bays made the Bloods pay for their inaccuracy by booting 4.3 to 0.4 after three-quarter time.
Noah Sims (22 disposals, one goal), Ethan Murdock (24 disposals, two goals) and Will Trevena (24 disposals) played integral roles for the Tigers as Jayden Davis booted four goals.
The Bloods, who kicked 8.18 for the match, listed Oscar Talbot (19 disposals), Jameson Whitbourne (24 disposals, nine tackles, one goal) and Kade Hilton (19 disposals, one goal) as their better performers.
