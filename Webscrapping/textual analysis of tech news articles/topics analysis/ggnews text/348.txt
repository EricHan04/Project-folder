The Morrison Government is investing more than $15 million in 19 nnovative research projects that will drive better health care through the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Development Grant scheme.
The grants will support researchers undertaking health and medical research within Australia at the proof-of-concept stage whose projects show potential for a commercial outcome within a foreseeable timeframe.
Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, said the funding would support the continued development of innovative products, processes, procedures and services and contribute to better health care in the future.
“Australia continues to be at the forefront of medical research and these projects have the potential to increase not only our understanding of diseases, but to also revolutionise their treatment,” Minister Hunt said.
“From the development of drugs to improve immunotherapy to methods to enhance the treatment of pancreatic cancers, these projects have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes.”
“Our Government continues to provide unprecedented support to health and medical research, as we back our best and brightest researchers to transform today’s ideas into breakthrough treatments for the patients of tomorrow.”
Grants included in this announcement will advance the development of a range of health and medical innovations, including:
A device that allows clinicians to assess a patient’s lung function so they can plan radiotherapy to minimise side effects and evaluate suitability for surgery.
A new form of RNA-based treatment for patients with liver cancer.
A compound that can prevent scarring caused by chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer patients which limits the effectiveness of subsequent rounds of treatment.
A new device to open blocked coronary arteries (angioplasty) that targets drug delivery to the surface of a re-narrowed blood vessel, for safer and more effective treatment of vascular disease.
A new, low-energy laser that rescues the light-sensitive film at the back of the eye to preserve central vision and prevent complete blindness from retinitis pigmentosa.
A highly active antimalarial drug class with a known mechanism of action and the prerequisites to advance to human clinical trials.
NHMRC CEO Professor Anne Kelso said it was exciting to see these innovations making progress along the path to patient care.
“We know that commercial development of medical technologies can be challenging. These grants fill a critical gap in that pathway by supporting research teams to obtain the proof-of-concept data needed to attract a commercial partner,” Professor Kelso said.
